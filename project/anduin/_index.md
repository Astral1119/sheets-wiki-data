The **anduin** package provides advanced data structures for Google Sheets formulas, including [[RECORD]] and [[PROTOCOL]] types.

Records are flexible data structures that can implement protocols to define shared behavior across different record types. Together they enable object-oriented programming patterns within Google Sheets.

## Functions

The **anduin** package provides advanced data structures for Google Sheets formulas, including [[RECORD]] and [[PROTOCOL]] types.

Records are flexible data structures that can implement protocols to define shared behavior across different record types. Together they enable object-oriented programming patterns within Google Sheets.

To install and use Anduin, please use [[Formulary]]. You can find more information about Anduin in the [Formulary registry](https://formulary.dev/packages/anduin/).

## Functions

The GAMMA.INV function returns the value of the inverse gamma cumulative distribution function for the specified probability, alpha, and beta parameters.

Parts of a GAMMA.INV formula
----------------------------

`GAMMA.INV(probability, alpha, beta)`

| Part | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `probability` | The input to the inverse gamma distribution function. | * Must be between 0 and 1. |
| `alpha` | The shape of the gamma distribution. | * Must be positive. * The sign of significance is ignored. |
| `beta` | The scale of the gamma distribution. | * Must be positive. |

Sample formulas
---------------

`GAMMA.INV(0.65, 4, 2)`

`GAMMA.INV(C3, 3, 2)`

Note
----

* You can use `GAMMAINV` or `GAMMA.INV` to perform this function.

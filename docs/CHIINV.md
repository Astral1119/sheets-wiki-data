Calculates the inverse of the right-tailed chi-squared distribution.

### Sample Usage

```gse
CHIINV(0.42, 2)
CHIINV(A2, B2)
```

### Syntax

```gse
CHIINV(probability, degrees_freedom)
```

- `probability` - The probability associated with the right-tailed chi-squared distribution.

  + Must be greater than `0` and less than `1`.
- `degrees_freedom` - The number of degrees of freedom of the distribution.

### Notes

- `degrees_freedom` is truncated to an integer if a non-integer is provided.
- `degrees_freedom` must be at least `1`.
- All arguments must be numeric.
- `CHIINV` is synonymous with `CHISQ.INV.RT`.

[[CHIDIST]]: Calculates the right-tailed chi-squared distribution, often used in hypothesis testing.

[[CHISQ.INV]]: Calculates the inverse of the left-tailed chi-squared distribution.

[[CHISQ.INV.RT]]: Calculates the inverse of the right-tailed chi-squared distribution.

[[CHITEST]]: Returns the probability associated with a Pearson’s chi-squared test on the two ranges of data. Determines the likelihood that the observed categorical data is drawn from an expected distribution.

[[FINV]]: Calculates the inverse of the right-tailed F probability distribution. Also called the Fisher-Snedecor distribution or Snedecor’s F distribution.

[[TINV]]: Calculates the inverse of the two-tailed TDIST function.

### Example

Suppose you want to find the cutoff for the chi-squared statistic associated with a p-value of `0.05`. With `4` degrees of freedom, you can consider any chi-squared statistic larger than `9.49` to be statistically significant.

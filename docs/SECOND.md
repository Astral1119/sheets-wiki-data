Returns the second component of a specific time, in numeric format.

### Sample Usage

```gse
SECOND(TIME(11,40,59))
SECOND(A2)
SECOND(40909.0004)
SECOND("20:49:59")
```

### Syntax

```gse
SECOND(time)
```

- `time` - The time from which to calculate the second component. Must be a reference to a cell containing a date/time, a function returning a date/time type, or a number.

### Notes

- Ensure that the input to the function is either a reference to a cell containing a date/time, a function which returns a date/time object such as [[TIME]], or a date serial number of the type returned by the [[N]] function. Google Sheets represents dates and times as numbers; while conversion is automatic when a human-readable date is entered into a cell, functions only accept literal dates in numeric format.
- `SECOND` does not autoconvert number formats in the same way that Google Sheets does upon direct entry into cells. Therefore, `SECOND(12:00:00)` will return an error.
- `SECOND` returns the intuitive understanding of seconds, and is useful primarily in other calculations rather than to extract the second component of a known time, as that value is easily known from a plain reading of the entire time.
- Note that date objects that are created with the [[DATE]] function or by entry of a date without a time component will have a time of 0:00:00.

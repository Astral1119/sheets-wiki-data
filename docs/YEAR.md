Returns the year specified by a given date.

### Sample Usage

`YEAR(DATE(1969,7,20))`

`YEAR(A2)`

`YEAR(40909)`

### Syntax

`YEAR(date)`

* `date` - The date from which to calculate the year. Must be a cell reference to a cell containing a date, a function returning a date type, or a number.

### Notes

* Ensure that the input to the function is either a reference to a cell containing a date, a function which returns a date object such as [[DATE]], [[DATEVALUE]] or [[TO_DATE]], or a date serial number of the type returned by the [[N]] function. Google Sheets represents dates and times as numbers; while conversion is automatic when a human-readable date is entered into a cell, functions only accept literal dates in numeric format.
* `YEAR` does not autoconvert number formats in the same way that Google Sheets does upon direct entry into cells. Therefore, `YEAR(10/10/2000)` is interpreted as `YEAR(0.005)`, the quotient of 10 divided by 10 divided by 2000.

Returns the product of two numbers. Equivalent to the `\*` operator.

### Sample Usage

```gse
MULTIPLY(A2,B2)
MULTIPLY(2,3)
```

### Syntax

```gse
MULTIPLY(factor1, factor2)
```

- `factor1` - The first multiplicand.
- `factor2` - The second multiplicand.

### Notes

- Unlike `PRODUCT`, `MULTIPLY` only supports the multiplication of two scalar values and takes neither ranges nor more than two arguments.

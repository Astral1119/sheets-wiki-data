The `IMLN` function returns the logarithm of a complex number, base e (Euler's number).

### Syntax
The `IMLN` formula is formatted as `=IIMLN(number).`

| **Part** | **Description** | **Notes** |
| number | The input value of the logarithm function. | * The number can be written as plain numbers, e.g. 1, to be interpreted as a real number. * The number can be written as quoted text in order to specify both the real and complex coefficients. |

### Sample formulas

```gse
IMLN("3+4i")
IMLN(A2)
IMLN("4+2j")
```

### Notes

- `IMLN` is equivalent to `LN` for all non-complex values that are greater than zero.
- `IMLN` is equivalent to `LOG` given base of `e`, or `EXP(1)`, for all non-complex values that are greater than zero.
- The natural logarithm of a complex number is defined as follows:
  + ln(x+yi) = √(x2+y2) + i tan-1(y/x)

### Examples

|  | A | B |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Formula** | **Result** |
| 2 | `=IMLN("1+i")` | 0.346573590279973+0.785398163397448i |
| 3 | `=IMLN("4+2j")` | 1.497866136777+0.463647609000806i |
| 4 | `=IMLN("-4.6")` | 1.52605630349505+3.14159265358979i |

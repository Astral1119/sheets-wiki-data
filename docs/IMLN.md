The `IMLN` function returns the logarithm of a complex number, base e (Euler's number).

### Parts of a IMLN formula

The `IMLN` formula is formatted as `=IIMLN(number).`

| **Part** | **Description** | **Notes** |
| number | The input value of the logarithm function. | * The number can be written as plain numbers, e.g. 1, to be interpreted as a real number. * The number can be written as quoted text in order to specify both the real and complex coefficients. |

### Sample formulas

`IMLN("3+4i")`

`IMLN(A2)`

`IMLN("4+2j")`

### Notes

* `IMLN` is equivalent to `LN` for all non-complex values that are greater than zero.
* `IMLN` is equivalent to `LOG` given base of `e`, or `EXP(1)`, for all non-complex values that are greater than zero.
* The natural logarithm of a complex number is defined as follows:
  + ln(x+yi) = √(x2+y2) + i tan-1(y/x)

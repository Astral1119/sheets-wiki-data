Returns the cell(s) found by index value into the referenced range.

### Sample Usage

`INDEX(A1:C20, 5, 1)`

### Syntax

`INDEX(reference, [row], [column])`

* `reference` - The range of cells from which the values are returned.
* `row` - **[**OPTIONAL - 0 by default**]** - The index of the row to be returned from within the reference range of cells.
* `column` - **[**OPTIONAL - `0` by default**]** - The index of the column to be returned from within the reference range of cells.

### Using INDEX and Match

INDEX and MATCH can be used together to perform more advanced and dynamic lookups.

* **Tip:** [[VLOOKUP]] can be used when the lookup value is to the left of the desired attribute to return. [[INDEX]] and [[MATCH]] can be used regardless of where the lookup value is located in the dataset.

| Guest Name | Dietary Restriction | Sent Invitation | Table Number |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| David | Vegetarian | No | 3 |
| Bob | None | No | 5 |
| david | None | Yes | 1 |
| Nancy | None | No | 4 |
| Mary | Vegetarian | Yes | 2 |

| Goal | Formula | Formula Output | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Find Mary's Dietary Restriction | =VLOOKUP("Mary", A1:D6, 2, false) | Vegetarian | **Both** search key and index are **hardcoded** |
| Find Mary's Dietary Restriction | =INDEX(A1:D6, MATCH("Mary", A1:A6, 0), 2) | Vegetarian | Row number is **dynamic** & column number is **hardcoded** |
| Find Mary's Dietary Restriction | =INDEX(A1:D6, MATCH("Mary", A1:A6, 0), MATCH("Dietary Restriction", A1:D1, 0)) | Vegetarian | **Both** row number & column number are **dynamic** |
| Find Who is at Table Number 2 | Using VLOOKUP, this would not be possible | N/A | VLOOKUP can only be used when the lookup value is to the **left of the desired attribute to return** |
| Find Who is at Table Number 2 | =INDEX(A1:D6, MATCH(2, D1:D6, 0), MATCH("Guest Name", A1:D1, 0)) | Mary | INDEX and MATCH can be used regardless of where the lookup value is located relative to the desired attribute to return |

### See Also

[[MATCH]]: Returns the relative position of an item in a range that matches a specified value.

[[OFFSET]]: Returns a range reference shifted a specified number of rows and columns from a starting cell reference.

### Notes

* If you set row or column to 0, `INDEX` returns the array of values for the entire column or row, respectively.

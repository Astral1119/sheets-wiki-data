Returns the difference between two complex numbers.

### Sample Usage

`IMSUB("6+5i", "2+3i")`

### Syntax

`IMSUB(first_number, second_number)`

* `first_number` - The complex number to subtract `second_number` from.
* `second_number` - The complex number to subtract from `first_number`.

### Notes

* The difference between two complex numbers is defined as follows:
  + (a+bi) - (c+di) = (a-c) + (b-d)i
* You can subtract two complex numbers only if they have the same suffix (i or j). For example, you can't do `IMSUB("4+3i", "1+2j")`.

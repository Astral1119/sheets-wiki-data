Returns the difference between two complex numbers.

### Sample Usage

```gse
IMSUB("6+5i", "2+3i")
```

### Syntax

```gse
IMSUB(first_number, second_number)
```

- `first_number` - The complex number to subtract `second_number` from.
- `second_number` - The complex number to subtract from `first_number`.

### Notes

- The difference between two complex numbers is defined as follows:
  + (a+bi) - (c+di) = (a-c) + (b-d)i
- You can subtract two complex numbers only if they have the same suffix (i or j). For example, you can't do `IMSUB("4+3i", "1+2j")`.

The AVERAGE.WEIGHTED function finds the weighted average of a set of values, given the values and the corresponding weights.

### Syntax
```gse
AVERAGE.WEIGHTED(values, weights, [additional values], [additional weights])
```

| Part | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `values` | The values to be averaged. | * May refer to a range of cells, or may contain the values themselves. |
| `weights` | The corresponding list of weights to apply. | * May refer to a range of cells, or may contain the weights themselves. * Weights cannot be negative, though they can be zero. * At least one of the weights must be positive. * If using a range of cells, that range must have the same number of rows and columns as the range of values. |
| `[additional_values]` | Additional values to average. | * Additional values are optional. |
| `[additional_weights]` | Additional weights to apply. | * Additional weights are optional, but each `additional_value` must be followed by exactly one `additional_weight`. |

### Sample formulas

```gse
AVERAGE.WEIGHTED(10, 1, 20, 3)
AVERAGE.WEIGHTED(A1:A2, B1:B2)
AVERAGE.WEIGHTED(A1:A2, B1:B2, C1, C2)
```

### Examples

This example shows the weighted averages of different numbers and weights:

| A | B | C | D |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | 2 | 1 | **Formula** | **Result** |
| **2** | 4 | 3 | =AVERAGE.WEIGHTED(A1:A2, B1:B2) | 3.5 |
| **3** | 8 | 6 | =AVERAGE.WEIGHTED(2, 10, 4, 15) | 3.2 |
| **4** |  |  | =AVERAGE.WEIGHTED(A1:A2, B1:B2, C1, C2) | 6.2 |

This example of weighted average calculates someone's grade in a school course:

| A | B | C |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | **Item** | **Grade** | **Percentage of final grade** |
| **2** | Homework | 95 | 25% |
| **3** | Participation | 90 | 10% |
| **4** | Midterm exam | 85 | 15% |
| **5** | Projects | 88 | 20% |
| **6** | Final exam | 82 | 30% |
| **7** |  | **Formula** | **Result** |
| **8** | Final grade | =AVERAGE.WEIGHTED(B2:B6, C2:C6) | 87.7 |

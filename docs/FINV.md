The F.INV.RT function calculates the inverse of the right-tailed F probability distribution. Also called the Fisher-Snedecor distribution or Snedecor’s F distribution.

### Sample Usage

`F.INV.RT(0.42, 2, 3)`

`F.INV.RT(A2, B2, C2)`

### Syntax

`F.INV.RT(probability, degrees_freedom1, degrees_freedom2)`

* `probability` - The probability associated with the right-tailed F-distribution.

  + Must be greater than `0` and less than `1`.
* `degrees_freedom1` - The number of degrees of freedom of the numerator of the test statistic.
* `degrees_freedom2` - The number of degrees of freedom of the denominator of the test statistic.

### Notes

* Both `degrees_freedom1` and `degrees_freedom2` are truncated to an integer in the calculation if a non-integer is provided as an argument.
* Both `degrees_freedom1` and `degrees_freedom2` must be at least `1`.
* All arguments must be numeric.
* `F.INV.RT` is synonymous with `FINV`.

[[F.DIST]]: Calculates the right-tailed F probability distribution (degree of diversity) for two data sets with given input x. Alternately called Fisher-Snedecor distribution or Snedecor's F distribution.

[[F.INV]]: Calculates the inverse of the left-tailed F probability distribution. Also called the Fisher-Snedecor distribution or Snedecor’s F distribution.

### Example

Suppose you want to find the cutoff for the F statistic associated with a p-value of `0.05`. With `4` and `5` as the degrees of freedom, you can consider any F statistic larger than `5.19` to be statistically significant.

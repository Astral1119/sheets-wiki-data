Replaces existing text with new text in a string.

### Sample Usage

```gse
SUBSTITUTE("search for it","search for","Google")
SUBSTITUTE(A2,"new york","New York")
SUBSTITUTE("January 2, 2012",2,3,1)
```

### Syntax

```gse
SUBSTITUTE(text_to_search, search_for, replace_with, [occurrence_number])
```

- `text_to_search` - The text within which to search and replace.
- `search_for` - The string to search for within `text_to_search`.

  + `search_for` will match parts of words as well as whole words; therefore a search for `"vent"` will also replace text within `"eventual"`.
- `replace_with` - The string that will replace `search_for`.
- `occurrence_number` - **[** OPTIONAL **]** - The instance of `search_for` within `text_to_search` to replace with `replace_with`. By default, all occurrences of `search_for` are replaced; however, if `occurrence_number` is specified, only the indicated instance of `search_for` is replaced.

### Notes

- `SUBSTITUTE` can be used to replace one or all instances of a string within `text_to_search`. It cannot be used to replace multiple, but not all instances within a single call.
- This function returns text as the output. If a number is desired, try using the [[VALUE]] function in conjunction with this function.

```gse
SUMSQ(A2:A100)
SUMSQ(1,2,3,4,5)
SUMSQ(1,2,A2:A50)
```

### Syntax

```gse
SUMSQ(value1, [value2, ...])
```

- `value1` - The first number or range whose squares to add together.
- `value2, ...` - **[** OPTIONAL **]** - Additional numbers or ranges whose squares to add to the square(s) of `value1`.

### Notes

- If only a single number for `value1` is supplied, `SUMSQ` returns `value1` squared.
- Although `SUMSQ` is specified as taking a maximum of 30 arguments, Google Sheets supports an arbitrary number of arguments for this function.

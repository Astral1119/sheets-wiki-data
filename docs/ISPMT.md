The ISPMT function calculates the interest paid during a particular period of an investment.

Parts of an ISPMT formula
-------------------------

`ISPMT(rate, period, number_of_periods, present_value)`

| Part | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rate` | The interest rate. |  |
| `period` | The time frame for which you want to view the interest payment. | Should be number between 1 and number\_of\_periods. |
| `number_of_periods` | The number of payments to be made. |  |
| `present_value` | The current value of the annuity. |  |

Sample formula
--------------

`ISPMT(15%, 2, 5, 1000)`

Notes
-----

Make sure that consistent units are used for the rate, period, and number of periods. For example, a car loan for 36 months may be paid monthly, in which case the annual percentage rate (APR) should be divided by 12 and the number of payments is 36. A different type of loan of the same length might be paid quarterly, in which case the APR should be divided by 4 and the number of payments would be 12.

Example
-------

| A | B |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | **Formula** | **Result** |
| **2** | =ISPMT(B1, B2, B3, B4) | -2400 |

The BIN2HEX function converts a signed binary number to signed hexadecimal format.

### Sample Usage

```gse
BIN2HEX(101,8)
BIN2HEX(A2)
```

### Syntax

```gse
BIN2HEX(signed_binary_number, [significant_digits])
```

- `signed_binary_number` - The signed 10-bit binary value to be converted to signed hexadecimal, provided as a string.

  + The most significant bit of `signed_binary_number` is the sign bit; that is, negative numbers are represented in two's complement format.
  + For this function, this value has a maximum of 0111111111 if positive, and a minimum of 1000000000 if negative.
  + If `signed_binary_number` is provided as a valid binary number, it will automatically be converted to the appropriate string input. For example, `BIN2HEX(11111)` and `BIN2HEX("11111")` yield the same result: `1F`.
- `significant_digits` - **[** OPTIONAL **]** - The number of significant digits to ensure in the result.

  + If this is greater than the number of significant digits in the result, the result is left-padded with zeros until the total number of digits reaches `significant_digits`. For example, `BIN2HEX("11111",8)` yields the value `0000001F`.
  + This value is ignored if the most significant bit of `signed_binary_number` is `1`; that is, if the expressed `signed_binary_number` is greater than or equal to 1000000000.

### Notes

- As with any binary value, only the digits `0` and `1` are valid. Digits other than these will cause `BIN2HEX` to return a `#NUM!` error.
- If the number of digits required is greater than the specified `significant_digits`, the `#NUM!` error is returned.
- Ensure that any calculations using the result of BIN2HEX take into account that it is in hexadecimal. In particular, results which do not contain non-decimal digits (`A-F`) will be silently converted by Google Sheets; thus if cell `A2` contains `111`, the hexadecimal equivalent of binary `100010001`, and `B2` contains a formula such as `=A2+9`, the result will be `120`, which is incorrect in hex calculation.

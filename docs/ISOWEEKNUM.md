Returns the number of the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) week of the year where the provided date falls.

### Sample Usage

```gse
ISOWEEKNUM(DATE(1969, 7, 20))
ISOWEEKNUM("6/14/2002")
```

### Syntax

```gse
ISOWEEKNUM(date)
```

- `date` - The date for which to determine the ISO week number. Must refer to a cell containing a date, number, or function returning a date type.

### Notes

- When entering the date, use the [[DATE]] function, as text values might return errors.
- Per the European system for numbering weeks (also known as ISO 8601):
  + Weeks begin on Monday and end on Sunday.
  + Week 1 of the year is the week containing the first Thursday of the year.
    - As a result, if the first Thursday is after January 4, at least one of the following days, January 1-3, will have an `ISOWEEKNUM` of 52 or 53.
    - Similarly, if the first Thursday is before January 4, at least one of the following days, December 29-31, will have an `ISOWEEKNUM` of 1.
    - If the first Thursday is January 4, December 29-31 of the previous year will have `ISOWEEKNUM` of 52 and January 1-7 of the current year will have `ISOWEEKNUM` of 1.

The CEILING.PRECISE function rounds a number up to the nearest integer or multiple of specified significance. If the number is positive or negative, it's rounded up.

### Syntax
```gse
CEILING.PRECISE(number, [significance])
```

| Part | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `number` | The value to round up to the nearest integer or multiple of `significance`. |  |
| `significance` | The number to whose multiples `number` will be rounded. The sign of `significance` will be ignored. | [OPTIONAL: 1 by default] |

### Sample formulas

`CEILING.PRECISE(-10.5, 1)  
CEILING.PRECISE(96, 10)  
CEILING.PRECISE(-23.25, 0.1)`

### Notes

- By default, positive numbers with decimal places are rounded up to the nearest integer. For example, 4.3 is rounded up to 5.
- Negative numbers are rounded up (toward zero). For example, -4.3 is rounded up to -4.

### Examples

| A | B |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | **Formula** | **Result** |
| **2** | `=CEILING.PRECISE(-10.5, 1)` | -10 |
| **3** | `=CEILING.PRECISE(96, 10)` | 100 |
| **4** | `=CEILING.PRECISE(-23.25, 0.1)` | 23.2 |

The QUARTILE.EXC function returns value nearest to a given quartile of a dataset, exclusive of 0 and 4.

### Syntax
```gse
QUARTILE.EXC(data, quartile_number)
```

| Part | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `data` | The array or range containing the dataset to consider. |
| `quartile_number` | This is which quartile value to return  * 1 returns the value in data closest to the first quartile (25% mark) * 2 returns the value in data closest to the median (50% mark) * 3 returns the value in data closest to the third quartile (75% mark) |

### Sample formulas

```gse
QUARTILE.EXC(A2:A100, 3)
QUARTILE.EXC(A2:A100, B2)
```

### Notes

- If the `quartile_number` is not an integer, the number is truncated.
- The `quartile_number` must be between 0 and 4, exclusive.
- Different from `QUARTILE.INC`, `QUARTILE.EXC` calculates quartile based on a quartile range exclusive of 0th and 4th quartile.

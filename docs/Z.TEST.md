Returns the one-tailed P-value of a Z-test with standard distribution.

### Sample Usage

```gse
Z.TEST(A2:A100,B2)
Z.TEST({1,2,3,4,5,6},5.5,1.2)
```

### Syntax

```gse
Z.TEST(data, value, [standard_deviation])
```

- `data` - The array or range containing the dataset to consider.
- `value` - The test statistic to use in the Z-test.
- `standard_deviation` - **[** OPTIONAL **]** - The standard deviation to assume for the Z-test. If this is not provided, `STDEV(data)` will be calculated.

### Notes

- The P-value returned by `Z.TEST` is the probability that a randomly generated sample (of the same size as the data) has a mean `value` greater than that of the original data set.
- You can use `ZTEST` or `Z.TEST` to perform this function.

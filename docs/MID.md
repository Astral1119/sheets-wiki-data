Returns a segment of a string.

### Sample Usage

`MID("get this",5,4)`

`MID(A2,3,5)`

### Syntax

`MID(string, starting_at, extract_length)`

* `string` - The string to extract a segment from.
* `starting_at` - The index from the left of `string` from which to begin extracting. The first character in `string` has the index 1.
* `extract_length` - The length of the segment to extract.

  + If the end of `string` is reached before `extract_length` characters are encountered, `MID` returns the characters from `starting_at` to the end of `string`.

### Notes

* To return the contents from `starting_at` to the end of `string`, use [[LEN]] to calculate the length of the string that will be returned rather than simply specifying a large number for `extract_length`.
* To return the contents of `string` beginning with a particular character or sub-string, use [[SEARCH]] to locate the index of the desired point.

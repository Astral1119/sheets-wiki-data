Calculates the left-tailed F probability distribution (degree of diversity) for two data sets with given input x. Alternately called Fisher-Snedecor distribution or Snedecor's F distribution.

### Sample Usage

```gse
F.DIST(15.35, 7, 6, TRUE)
F.DIST(A2, B2, C2, FALSE)
```

### Syntax

```gse
F.DIST(x, degrees_freedom1, degrees_freedom2, cumulative)
```

- `x` - The input to the F probability distribution function. The value at which to evaluate the function.

  + Must be a positive number.
- `degrees_freedom1` - The numerator degrees of freedom.
- `degrees_freedom2` - The denominator degrees of freedom.
- `cumulative` - Logical value that determines the form of the function. Default value is `FALSE`.

  + If `TRUE`: `F.DIST` returns the cumulative distribution function.
  + If `FALSE`: `F.DIST` returns the probability density function.

### Notes

- Both `degrees_freedom1` and `degrees_freedom2` are truncated to an integer in the calculation if a non-integer is provided as an argument.
- Both `degrees_freedom1` and `degrees_freedom2` must be greater than `1` and may not exceed `10^10`.
- `x`, `degrees_freedom1`, and `degrees_freedom2` must be numeric.

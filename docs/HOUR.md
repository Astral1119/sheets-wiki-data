Returns the hour component of a specific time, in numeric format.

### Sample Usage

`HOUR(TIME(11,40,59))`

`HOUR(A2)`

`HOUR(40909.0004)`

`HOUR("20:49:59")`

### Syntax

`HOUR(time)`

* `time` - The time from which to calculate the hour component. Must be a reference to a cell containing a date/time, a function returning a date/time type, or a number.

### Notes

* Ensure that the input to the function is either a reference to a cell containing a date/time, a function which returns a date/time object such as [[TIME]], or a date serial number of the type returned by the [[N]] function. Google Sheets represents dates and times as numbers; while conversion is automatic when a human-readable date is entered into a cell, functions only accept literal dates in numeric format.
* `HOUR` does not autoconvert number formats in the same way that Google Sheets does upon direct entry into cells. Therefore, `HOUR(12:00:00)` will return an error.
* `HOUR` returns the intuitive understanding of hours, and is useful primarily in other calculations rather than to extract the hour component of a known time, as that value is easily known from a plain reading of the entire time.
* Note that date objects that are created with the [[DATE]] function or by entry of a date without a time component will have a time of 0:00:00.

The IMEXP function returns Euler's number, e (~2.718) raised to a complex power.

### Syntax
`IMEXP`(exponent)

| Part | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `exponent` | The exponent to raise e to. |

### Sample formulas

```gse
IMEXP("2+3i")
IMEXP("2-4j")
IMEXP(COMPLEX(2, 3))
```

### Notes

- The exponential of a complex number is defined as follows:

IMEXP(x+yi) = excos(y) + iexsin(y)

### Examples

| 1 | Formula | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **2** | =IMEXP("1+i") | 1.46869393991589+2.28735528717884i |
| **3** | =IMEXP("2-2j") | -3.07493232063936-6.71884969742825j |

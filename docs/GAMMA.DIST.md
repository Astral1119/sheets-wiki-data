The GAMMA.DIST function calculates the gamma distribution, a 2-parameter continuous probability distribution.

### Sample Usage

`GAMMA.DIST(4.79, 1.234, 7, TRUE)`

`GAMMA.DIST(A1, B1, C1, FALSE)`

### Syntax

`GAMMA.DIST(x, alpha, beta, cumulative)`

* `x` - The input to the gamma probability distribution function. The value at which to evaluate the function.
* `alpha` - The shape of gamma distribution.
* `beta` - The scale of the distribution.
* `cumulative` - Logical value that determines the form of the function.

  + If `TRUE: GAMMA.DIST` returns the left-tailed cumulative distribution function.
  + If `FALSE: GAMMA.DIST` returns the probability density function.

### Notes

* `x`, `alpha`, and `beta` must be numeric.
* `alpha` and `beta` must be greater than zero.
* If `alpha` is less than or equal to `1` and `cumulative` is `FALSE`, then `x` must be greater than zero; otherwise, `x` must be greater than or equal to zero.
* `GAMMA.DIST` is synonymous with `GAMMADIST`.
* The chi-squared distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution. For an integer `n > 0`, `GAMMA.DIST(x, n/2, 2, cumulative)` is equivalent to `CHISQ.DIST(x, n, cumulative)`.

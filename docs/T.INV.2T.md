The T.INV.2T function calculates the inverse of the two-tailed TDIST function.

### Sample Usage

`T.INV.2T(0.35, 1)`

`T.INV.2T(A1, A2)`

### Syntax

`T.INV.2T(probability, degrees_freedom)`

* `probability` - The probability associated with the two-tailed t-distribution.

  + Must be greater than `0` and less than `1`.
* `degrees_freedom` - The number of degrees of freedom.

  + Truncated to an integer in the calculation if a non-integer is provided as an argument.
  + Must be greater than or equal to `1`.

### Notes

* `T.INV.2T` is to be used for the inverse of two-tailed `TDIST` functions.
* `T.INV.2T` is synonymous with `TINV`.
* To calculate the negative inverse of the one-tailed `TDIST` function, use `T.INV`.
* Both arguments to `T.INV.2T` must be numeric or a destination cell whose value is numeric.

### Examples

In this example, `T.INV.2T` uses the probability associated with a Student's two-tailed t-distribution and degrees of freedom to return its result.

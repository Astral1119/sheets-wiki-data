The BITAND function returns the bitwise boolean AND of two numbers. [Learn more.](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/9061440) The truth table of BITAND is provided below:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | B | BITAND(A,B) |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

### Syntax
```gse
BITAND(value1,value2)
```

| Part | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `value1` | The first number. | Must be the decimal representation of the number. |
| `value2` | The second number. | Must be the decimal representation of the number. |

### Notes

It may make sense to use BITAND in conjunction with BIN2DEC as follows:

- BITAND(BIN2DEC(“1010”), BIN2DEC(“1001”)) which evaluates to “1000” in binary or 8 in decimal.

### Examples

10 in decimal is “1010” in binary. 9 in decimal is “1001” in binary. The result is “1000” in binary, which is 8 in decimal.

| A | B |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | **Formula** | **Result** |
| **2** | `=BITAND(10,9)` | 8 |

The bitwise boolean AND of binary numbers “1110” and “0100” is the binary number “0100”, which is 4 in decimal.

| A | B |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | **Formula** | **Result** |
| **2** | `=BITAND(BIN2DEC("1110"), BIN2DEC("0100"))` | 4 |

Converts an hour, minute, and second into a time.

### Sample Usage

`TIME(11,40,59)`

`TIME(A2,B2,C2)`

### Syntax

`TIME(hour, minute, second)`

* `hour` - The hour component of the time.
* `minute` - The minute component of the time.
* `second` - The second component of the time.

### Notes

* Inputs to `TIME` must be numbers - if a string or a reference to a cell containing a string is provided, the `#VALUE!` error will be returned.
* `TIME` will silently recalculate numeric time values which fall outside of valid ranges. For example, `TIME(25,0,0)`, which specifies the illegal hour 25, will create a time of 1:00 AM. Similarly, `TIME(12,0,60)`, which specifies the illegal 61st second of a minute (:00 being the first second), will create a time of 12:01:00.
* `TIME` will silently truncate decimal values input into the function, e.g. an hour of 12.75 will be interpreted as 12.

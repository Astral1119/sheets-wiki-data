The IMLOG10 function returns the logarithm of a complex number with base 10.

Parts of an IMLOG10 formula
---------------------------

`IMLOG10(value)`

| Part | Desription | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `value` | The input value of the logarithm function. | * The number can be written as plain numbers, for example 1, to be interpreted as a real number. * The number can be written as quoted text in order to specify both the real and complex coefficients. |

Sample formulas
---------------

`IMLOG10("1+i", 3.5)`

`IMLOG10(COMPLEX(25, 34), 2.3)`

`IMLOG10(100, 10)`

Note
----

`IMLOG10` is equivalent to `IMLOG` given base of 10 for all numbers.

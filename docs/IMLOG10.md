The IMLOG10 function returns the logarithm of a complex number with base 10.

### Parts of an IMLOG10 formula

```gse
IMLOG10(value)
```

| Part | Desription | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `value` | The input value of the logarithm function. | * The number can be written as plain numbers, for example 1, to be interpreted as a real number. * The number can be written as quoted text in order to specify both the real and complex coefficients. |

### Sample formulas

```gse
IMLOG10("1+i", 3.5)
IMLOG10(COMPLEX(25, 34), 2.3)
IMLOG10(100, 10)
```

### Note

`IMLOG10` is equivalent to `IMLOG` given base of 10 for all numbers.

### Examples

| A | B |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | **Formula** | **Result** |
| **2** | `=IMLOG10("1+i")` | 0.150514997831991+0.34109408846046i |
| **3** | `=IMLOG10(COMPLEX(25, 34))` | 1.62533195973162+0.406835608369804i |
| **4** | `=IMLOG10(100)` | 2 |

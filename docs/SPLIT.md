### Sample Usage

`SPLIT("1,2,3", ",")`

`SPLIT("Alas, poor Yorick"," ")`

`SPLIT(A1, ",")`

### Syntax

`SPLIT(text, delimiter, [split_by_each], [remove_empty_text])`

* `text` - The text to divide.
* `delimiter` - The character or characters to use to split `text`.

  + By default, each character in `delimiter` is considered individually, e.g. if `delimiter` is `"the"`, then `text` is divided around the characters `"t"`, `"h"`, and `"e"`. Set `split_by_each` to `FALSE` to turn off this behavior.
* `split_by_each` - **[** OPTIONAL - `TRUE` by default **]** - Whether or not to divide `text` around each character contained in `delimiter`.
* `remove_empty_text` Â - [ OPTIONAL - `TRUE` by default ] - Whether or not to remove empty text messages from the split results. The default behavior is to treat consecutive delimiters as one (if `TRUE`). If `FALSE`, empty cells values are added between consecutive delimiters.

### Notes

* Note that the character or characters to split the string around will not be contained in the result themselves.

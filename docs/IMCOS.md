The IMCOS function returns the cosine of the given complex number. For example, a given complex number "x+yi" returns "cos(x+yi)."

Parts of an IMCOS formula
-------------------------

`IMCOS(number)`

| Part | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `number` | The complex number for which you want the cosine. | This can be either the result of the COMPLEX function, a real number (which will be interpreted as a complex number with imaginary part equal to 0), or a string in the format “x+yi” where x and y are numeric. |

Sample formulas
---------------

`IMCOS(COMPLEX(4, 6))`

`IMCOS(4)`

`IMCOS("2+3i")`

Notes
-----

The IMCOS function returns an error if the given number isn't a valid complex number.

Examples
--------

| A | B |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | **Formula** | **Result** |
| **2** | =IMCOS(COMPLEX(4, 1)) | -1.00862481342516+0.889395195838485i |
| **3** | =IMCOS(3.5) | -0.936456687290796 |
| **4** | =IMCOS("3+2i") | -3.72454550491532-0.511822569987385i |

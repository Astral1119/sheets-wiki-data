The GAMMA function returns the Gamma function evaluated at the specified value.

### Syntax
```gse
GAMMA(number)
```

| Part | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `number` | The input to the Gamma function. The natural logarithm of Gamma (number) will be returned.  The number must be positive. |

### Sample formulas

```gse
GAMMA(A1:A10)
GAMMA(1, 2, 3, 4)
GAMMA(B1:B5, 10)
```

### Notes

`GAMMA` is used for certain types of analysis or as a component to other functions and is rarely used by itself.

### Examples

| A | B |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | **Result** | **Formula** |
| **2** | 11.6317284 | `=GAMMA(4.5)` |
| **3** | 2 | `=GAMMA(3)` |

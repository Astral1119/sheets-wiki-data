Tests an expression against a list of cases and returns the corresponding value of the first matching case, with an optional default value if nothing else is met.

### Sample Usage

```gse
SWITCH(A1:A10, 0, “No”, 1, “Other”)
SWITCH(A3:A8, 4, “Four”, 8, “Eight”)
```

### Syntax

```gse
SWITCH(expression, case1, value1, [case2, value2, ...], [default])
```

- `expression` - Any valid values.
- `case1` - The first case to be checked against `expression`.
- `value1` - The corresponding value to be returned if `case1` matches `expression`.
- `case2, value2, … -` **Optional:** Additional cases and values if the first one doesn’t match the expression.
- `default -` **Optional:**An optional value, specified as the last parameter, to be returned if none of the cases match the expression.

### See Also

[[IFS]]:

Evaluates multiple conditions and returns a value that corresponds to the first true condition.

[[IF]]: Returns one value if a logical expression is `TRUE` and another if it is `FALSE`.

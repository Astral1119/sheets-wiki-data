This function maps each value in the given arrays to a new value by application of a `LAMBDA` function to each value.

Sample Usage
------------

`MAP(A1:A5, LAMBDA(cell, cell*2))`: `MAP` function with range as input.

`MAP(A1:A5, B1:B5, LAMBDA(cell1, cell2, MAX(cell1, cell2)))`: `MAP` function with multiple ranges as input.

`MAP(UNIQUE(A1:A10), LAMBDA(number, number + 1))`: `MAP` function with array as input.

Syntax
------

`MAP(array1, [array2, ...], LAMBDA)`

* `array1`: An array or range to be mapped.
* `array2, …`: [OPTIONAL] Additional arrays or ranges to be mapped.
* `LAMBDA`: A `LAMBDA` function that’s mapped to each value in the given arrays to obtain a new mapped value.
  + **Syntax:** `LAMBDA(name1, [name2, …], formula_expression)`
  + **Requirements:**
    - The `LAMBDA` must have exactly 1 `name` argument for each array passed, along with a `formula_expression` which uses those names. When `LAMBDA` is applied, the names resolve to the current values being mapped in the passed arrays.

Notes
-----

* The passed `LAMBDA` function should accept exactly as many `name` arguments as the number of input arrays given to `MAP`, otherwise an `#N/A` error is returned. These arguments correspond to the values in the input arrays which are being mapped to a new value.
* Values in the input arrays should map to a single value. Array results for mapped values aren’t supported.
* A `named function` can be passed for the `LAMBDA` parameter and behaves like a `LAMBDA` in this case. [Learn more about named functions](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/12504534).
  + There should be exactly as many argument placeholders defined for it as the number of input arrays passed to `MAP`.
  + The `named function` shouldn't be followed by parenthesis.

Examples
--------

### Simple doubling operation with MAP

**Example data:**

|  | A | B | C | D |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 3 | 4 |
| 3 |  |  | 2 | 4 |
| 4 | 6 | 8 |

**Example:** Input this formula in `C3:` `=MAP(A1:B2, LAMBDA(cell, cell*2))`

### Map a comma separated values to hyphenated SKU codes

**Example Data:**

|  | A | B |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Jeans,Black,XL | Jeans-Black-XL |
| 2 | Shorts,Brown,S | Shorts-Brown-S |
| 3 | Tshirt,Red,L | Tshirt-Red-L |
| 4 | Skirt,Pink,M | Skirt-Pink-M |

**Example:** Input this formula in `B1:` `=MAP(A1:A4, LAMBDA(item, JOIN("-", SPLIT(item, ","))))`

### Map multiple input ranges to the max value in each data set

**Example Data:**

|  | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 38.9 | 17.8 |  | 42 | 20.2 |  | 38.6 | 21.2 |
| 2 | 39.2 | 19.6 |  | 37.8 | 17.1 | 34.6 | 21.2 |
| 3 | 34.1 | 18.1 | 41.1 | 17.6 | 36.6 | 17.8 |

**Example:** `=MAP(A1:B3, D1:E3, G1:H3, LAMBDA(valA, valB, valC, MAX(valA, valB, valC)))`

**Result:**

|  | A | B |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 42 | 21.2 |
| 2 | 39.2 | 21.2 |
| 3 | 41.1 | 18.1 |

### Use a named function as a LAMBDA to count cells which have numbers in them

**Example Data:**

|  | A | B | C |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 13 Going On 30 | 2 Fast 2 Furious | 12 Angry Men |
| 2 | Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind | Friday the 13th | No Country for Old Men |

**Named function:** `CONTAINS_NUMBER` is a `named function` which checks if the given string value contains any number.

**Formula definition:** `=ARRAYFORMULA(OR(ISNUMBER(SPLIT(cell, " "))))`, where cell is an argument placeholder defined for `CONTAINS_NUMBER`.

**Example:** `=COUNTIF(MAP(A1:C2, CONTAINS_NUMBER), true)`

**Result:**

| --- |
| 3 |

Common Errors
-------------

The dimensions of the input arrays don’t match

If the dimensions of the input arrays don’t match, this error occurs:

“Array arguments to MAP are of different size.”

**Example:** `=MAP(C1:C4, D1:D2, LAMBDA(x, x+1))`

In this example, array `C1:C4` doesn’t match the size of array `D1:D2`.

The passed LAMBDA doesn’t have exactly as many name arguments as the number of input arrays

If the passed `LAMBDA` doesn’t have exactly as many `name` arguments as the number of input arrays given to `MAP`, this error occurs:

“Wrong number of arguments to LAMBDA. Expected 3 arguments, but got 2 arguments.

**Example:** `=MAP(C1:C4, D1:D4, LAMBDA(cell, cell+1))`

In this example, `LAMBDA` was given only 1 `name` argument cell, even though we passed 2 arrays to `MAP`.

The last parameter of MAP wasn’t a LAMBDA

If the last parameter of `MAP` wasn’t a `LAMBDA`, this error occurs:

“Argument must be a LAMBDA.”

**Example:** `=MAP(C1:C3, 3)`

The LAMBDA passed to MAP was incorrect

If the 1 or more `name` arguments aren’t valid, this error occurs:

“Argument 1 of function LAMBDA is not a valid name.”

**Example:** `=MAP(C1:C3, LAMBDA(C1, C1+1))`

In this example, `C1` is an invalid `name` since it clashes with a range.

The application of LAMBDA on the input array(s) maps to multiple values or another array

If the application of `LAMBDA` on the input array(s) maps each value to multiple values or another array, this error occurs:

“Single value expected. Nested array results are not supported.”

**Example:** `=MAP(E1, LAMBDA(word, SPLIT(word, " ")))`

In this example, we try to map the text in the cell to an array of words.

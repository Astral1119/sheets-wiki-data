Calculates the matrix product of two matrices specified as arrays or ranges.

### Sample Usage

```gse
MMULT(A1:B3,C1:F2)
MMULT({1,2,3;4,5,6},{7;8;9})
```

### Syntax

```gse
MMULT(matrix1, matrix2)
```

- `matrix1` - The first matrix in the matrix multiplication operation, represented as an array or range.
- `matrix2` - The second matrix in the matrix multiplication operation, represented as an array or range.

### Notes

- As standard in matrix multiplication, the number of columns for `matrix1` must equal the number of rows for `matrix2`

Converts a Unix epoch timestamp in seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds to a datetime in Universal Time Coordinated(UTC).

### Sample Usage

```gse
EPOCHTODATE(A1,1)
EPOCHTODATE(1655908429662,2)
EPOCHTODATE(1655906710)
```

### Syntax

```gse
EPOCHTODATE(timestamp, [unit])
```

- `Timestamp`: A Unix epoch timestamp, in seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds.
- `Unit` [OPTIONAL `– 1` by default]: The unit of time in which the timestamp is expressed.

- `1` indicates the time unit is seconds.
- `2` indicates the time unit is milliseconds.
- `3` indicates the time unit is microseconds.

### Notes

- Seconds is the default unit of time.
- Fractional amounts of milliseconds are shortened.
- The result will be in UTC, not the local time zone of your spreadsheet.
- Negative timestamps aren’t accepted.
- The result is computed by dividing the timestamp (converted to milliseconds) by the number of milliseconds in a day and adding 25,568. [Learn more about dates in Sheets](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3092969).

Converts a Unix epoch timestamp in seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds to a datetime in Universal Time Coordinated(UTC).

Sample Usage
------------

`EPOCHTODATE(A1,1)`

`EPOCHTODATE(1655908429662,2)`

`EPOCHTODATE(1655906710)`

Syntax
------

`EPOCHTODATE(timestamp, [unit])`

* `Timestamp`: A Unix epoch timestamp, in seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds.
* `Unit` [OPTIONAL `– 1` by default]: The unit of time in which the timestamp is expressed.

* `1` indicates the time unit is seconds.
* `2` indicates the time unit is milliseconds.
* `3` indicates the time unit is microseconds.

Notes
-----

* Seconds is the default unit of time.
* Fractional amounts of milliseconds are shortened.
* The result will be in UTC, not the local time zone of your spreadsheet.
* Negative timestamps aren’t accepted.
* The result is computed by dividing the timestamp (converted to milliseconds) by the number of milliseconds in a day and adding 25,568. [Learn more about dates in Sheets](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3092969).

`XMATCH` returns the relative position of an item in an array or range that matches a specified value. `XMATCH`:

- Supports enhanced match and search functionality
- Allows wildcard matches with a question mark (?) or asterisk (\*)

### Sample usage

```gse
XMATCH("Apple", A2:A)
XMATCH("Price", A2:A)
```

### Syntax

```gse
XMATCH(search_key, lookup_range, [match_mode], [search_mode])
```

- `search_key`: The value to search for. For example, `42`, `"Cats"`, or `B24`.
- `lookup_range`: The range to consider for the search. This range must be a singular row or column.
- `match_mode`: [OPTIONAL: `0` by default] The manner in which to find a match for the `search_key`.
  + `0` is for an exact match.
  + `1` is for an exact match or the next value that's greater than the `search_key`.
  + `-1` is for an exact match or the next value that's lesser than the `search_key`.
  + `2` is for a wildcard match.
- `search_mode`: [OPTIONAL: `1` by default] The manner in which to search through the lookup range.
  + `1` is to search from the first entry to the last.
  + `-1` is to search from the last entry to the first.
  + `2` is to search through the range with binary search. The range needs to be sorted in ascending order first.
  + `-2` is to search through the range with binary search. The range needs to be sorted in descending order first.

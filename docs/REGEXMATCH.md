Whether a piece of text matches a regular expression.

### Sample Usage

```gse
REGEXMATCH("Spreadsheets", "S.r")
```

### Syntax

```gse
REGEXMATCH(text, regular_expression)
```

- `text` - The text to be tested against the regular expression.
- `regular_expression` - The regular expression to test the text against.

### Notes

- Google products use RE2 for regular expressions. Google Sheets supports RE2 except Unicode character class matching. Learn more on [how to use RE2 expressions](https://github.com/google/re2/blob/master/doc/syntax.txt).
- This function only works with text (not numbers) as input and returns a logical value, i.e. `TRUE` or `FALSE`, as output. If numbers are used as input, convert them to text using the [[TEXT]] function.

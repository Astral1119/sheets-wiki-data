Returns the month of the year a specific date falls in, in numeric format.

### Sample Usage

```gse
MONTH(DATE(1969, 7, 20))
MONTH(A2)
MONTH(40909)
MONTH("7/20/1969")
```

### Syntax

```gse
MONTH(date)
```

- `date` - The date from which to extract the month. Must be a reference to a cell containing a date, a function returning a date type, or a number.

### Notes

- Ensure that the input to the function is either a reference to a cell containing a date, a function which returns a date object such as [[DATE]], [[DATEVALUE]] or [[TO_DATE]], or a date serial number of the type returned by the [[N]] function. Google Sheets represents dates as numbers; while conversion is automatic when a human-readable date is entered into a cell, functions only accept literal dates in numeric format.
- `MONTH` does not autoconvert number formats in the same way that Google Sheets does upon direct entry into cells. Therefore, `MONTH(10/10/2000)` is interpreted as `MONTH(0.005)`, the quotient of 10 divided by 10 divided by 2000.
- `MONTH` returns the intuitive understanding of the month of the year, and is useful primarily in other calculations rather than to extract the month from a known date, as that value is easily known from a plain reading of the entire date.

The IMLOG function returns the logarithm of a complex number for a specified base.

### Syntax
The `IMLOG` formula is formatted as `=IMLOG(value, base)`.

| Part | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `value` | The input value of the logarithm function. | * The number can be written as plain numbers, e.g. 1, to be interpreted as a real number. * The number can be written as quoted text in order to specify both the real and complex coefficients. |
| `base` | The base to use when calculating the logarithm. | Must be a positive real number. |

### Sample formulas

```gse
IMLOG("1+i", 3.5)
IMLOG(COMPLEX(25, 34), 2.3)
IMLOG(100, 10)
```

### Notes

- `IMLOG` is equivalent to `LOG` for all non-complex values that are greater than zero.
- `IMLOG` is equivalent to `IMLN` given base of `e`, or `EXP(1)`.
- `IMLOG` is equivalent to `IMLOG10` given base of `10`.
- `IMLOG` is equivalent to `IMLOG2`  given base of `2`.

### Examples

| A | B |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | **Formula** | **Result** |
| **2** | `=IMLOG("1+i", 3.5)` | 0.276647377832556+0.626932774314643i |
| **3** | `=IMLOG(COMPLEX(25, 34), 2.3)` | 4.49324546771284+1.12470086031758i |
| **4** | `=IMLOG(100, 10)` | 2 |

The IMLOG function returns the logarithm of a complex number for a specified base.

Parts of an IMLOG formula
-------------------------

The `IMLOG` formula is formatted as `=IMLOG(value, base)`.

| Part | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `value` | The input value of the logarithm function. | * The number can be written as plain numbers, e.g. 1, to be interpreted as a real number. * The number can be written as quoted text in order to specify both the real and complex coefficients. |
| `base` | The base to use when calculating the logarithm. | Must be a positive real number. |

Sample formulas
---------------

`IMLOG("1+i", 3.5)`

`IMLOG(COMPLEX(25, 34), 2.3)`

`IMLOG(100, 10)`

Notes
-----

* `IMLOG` is equivalent to `LOG` for all non-complex values that are greater than zero.
* `IMLOG` is equivalent to `IMLN` given base of `e`, or `EXP(1)`.
* `IMLOG` is equivalent to `IMLOG10` given base of `10`.
* `IMLOG` is equivalent to `IMLOG2` Â given base of `2`.

Calculates the sum of squares of deviations based on a sample.

### Sample Usage

`DEVSQ(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)`

`DEVSQ(A2:A100)`

### Syntax

`DEVSQ(value1, [value2, ...])`

* `value1` - The first value or range of the sample.
* `value2, ...` - Additional values or ranges to include in the sample.

### Notes

* Although `DEVSQ` is specified as taking a maximum of 30 arguments, Google Sheets supports an arbitrary number of arguments for this function.
* If the total number of values supplied as `value` arguments is not at least two, `DEVSQ` will return a value of `0`.
* `DEVSQ` will ignore any text values found in ranges included in `value` arguments.
* `DEVSQ` is equivalent to the variance of a sample multiplied by the number of elements in the sample minus one; that is, `(COUNT(...)-1)*VAR(...)` where `COUNT` and `VAR` are called on the same dataset.

Calculates the date after a specified number of workdays excluding specified weekend days and holidays.

### Sample Usage

`WORKDAY.INTL(DATE(1969, 7, 21), 4, 1, A1:A10)`

`WORKDAY.INTL(DATE(1995, 8, 13), -2, 2, B1:B10)`

`WORKDAY.INTL(DATE(1969, 7, 21), 0)`

### Syntax

`WORKDAY.INTL(start_date, num_days, [weekend], [holidays])`

* `start_date` - The date from which to begin counting.
* `num_days` - The number of working days to advance from start\_date. If negative, counts backwards.
* `weekend` - **[** OPTIONAL - `1` by default **]** - A number or string representing which days of the week are considered weekends.
  + **String method**: weekends can be specified using seven 0’s and 1’s, where the first number in the set represents Monday and the last number is for Sunday. A zero means that the day is a work day, a 1 means that the day is a weekend. For example, “0000011” would mean Saturday and Sunday are weekends.
  + **Number method**: instead of using the string method above, a single number can be used. 1 = Saturday/Sunday are weekends, 2 = Sunday/Monday, and this pattern repeats until 7 = Friday/Saturday. 11 = Sunday is the only weekend, 12 = Monday is the only weekend, and this pattern repeats until 17 = Saturday is the only weekend.
* `holidays` - **[** OPTIONAL **]** - A range or array constant containing the dates to consider holidays.

### Notes

* `WORKDAY.INTL` does not autoconvert number formats in the same way that Google Sheets does upon direct entry into cells. Therefore, `WORKDAY.INTL(10/10/2000,4)` is interpreted as `WORKDAY.INTL(0.005,4)`, where the provided date is the quotient of 10 divided by 10 divided by 2000.
* `WORKDAY.INTL` calculates a number of working days after a given date. To calculate the number of working days between two dates, use [[NETWORKDAYS.INTL]].
* `WORKDAY.INTL` works similarly to `WORKDAY` but also allows weekend days to be specified (for areas where Saturday and Sunday are not considered the weekend).

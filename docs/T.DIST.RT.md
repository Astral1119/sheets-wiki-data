Returns the right tailed Student distribution for a value x. Along with `T.DIST.2T,` this function replaces `TDIST` and is equivalent to calling `TDIST` with the tails argument set to 1.

Parts of a T.DIST.RT function
-----------------------------

`T.DIST.2T(x, degrees_freedom)`

| Part | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `x` | Required. The x value to evaluate the distribution at. |
| `degrees_freedom` | Required. The degrees of freedom. |

Sample formulas
---------------

`Example 1: A1 has T.DIST.RT(1.96, 60)  
Example 2: A1 has T.DIST.RT(-1.98, 2)`

Notes
-----

* If deg\_freedom is less than 1, returns an `#NUM` error.
* This formula along with `T.DIST.2T` replace the `TDIST` formula. `T.DIST.RT` is equivalent to calling the `TDIST` formula with tails = 1.

Examples
--------

Result for A1=`T.DIST.RT(1.96, 60)`

| A | B |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | 0.027322464868265 |  |
| **2** |  |  |

Result for A1=`T.DIST.RT(-1.98, 2)`

| A | B |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | 0.9068737480782105 |  |
| **2** |  |  |

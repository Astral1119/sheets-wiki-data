Returns the current date and time as a date value.

### Sample Usage

```gse
NOW()
```

### Syntax

```gse
NOW()
```

### Notes

- Note that `NOW` is a volatile function, updating on every edit made to the spreadsheet, and can hurt spreadsheet performance.
- `NOW` provides the current date and time. To create a date without the current time, use [[TODAY]].
- `NOW` will always represent the current date and time the last time the spreadsheet was recalculated, rather than remaining at the date and time when it was first entered.
- The time or date component of NOW may be hidden by changing the number formatting on the cell. If either the date or time is not appearing, [change the number formatting](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/56470).

### See Also

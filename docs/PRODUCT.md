Returns the result of multiplying a series of numbers together.

### Sample Usage

```gse
PRODUCT(A2:A100)
PRODUCT(1,2,3,4,5,A2:A100)
```

### Syntax

```gse
PRODUCT(factor1, [factor2, ...])
```

- `factor1` - The first number or range to calculate for the product.
- `factor2 ... factor 30` - **[** OPTIONAL **]** - Additional values to multiply by.

### Notes

- If only a single number for `factor1` is supplied, `PRODUCT` returns `factor1`.
- Each `factor` may be a number or a range. If a range, empty cells are ignored.
- Although `PRODUCT` is specified as taking a maximum of 30 arguments, Google Sheets supports an arbitrary number of arguments for this function.

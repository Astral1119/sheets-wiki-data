**Error** is a [[data type]] representing failed formula evaluation. When a formula cannot compute a valid result, it returns an error value that propagates through dependent calculations.

### Error Types

Google Sheets recognizes the following error types:

| Error | Name | Typical Cause |
|-------|------|---------------|
| `#ERROR!` | ERROR | Generic error or circular dependency detected |
| `#NULL!` | NULL_VALUE | Invalid range intersection (using space operator incorrectly) |
| `#DIV/0` | DIVIDE_BY_ZERO | Division by zero or empty cell |
| `#VALUE!` | VALUE | Wrong type of argument or incompatible operation |
| `#REF!` | REF | Invalid cell reference (deleted cells, out of bounds) |
| `#NAME?` | NAME | Unrecognized function or range name |
| `#NUM!` | NUM | Invalid numeric value in formula |
| `#N/A` | N_A | Value not available (lookup functions, explicit NA()) |
| `Loading...` | LOADING | Formula is currently being calculated |

### Error Propagation

Errors propagate through formulas. If a cell contains an error, any formula referencing that cell also returns an error (typically the same error type). This cascading behavior helps identify the source of calculation problems.

Exceptions:
- [[IFERROR]] can intercept and replace errors
- [[IFNA]] specifically handles `#N/A` errors
- [[ISERROR]], [[ISERR]], [[ISNA]] can test for errors without propagating them
- Certain functions like [[AGGREGATE]] and [[SUBTOTAL]] can ignore error values

### Common Causes

#### `#ERROR!`
- Circular references in formulas
- Parsing errors in expressions
- Array formula size mismatches

#### `#NULL!`
- Incorrect use of space as intersection operator
- Example: `=SUM(A1:A10 B1:B10)` when ranges don't intersect

#### `#DIV/0`
- Dividing by zero: `=1/0`
- Dividing by empty cell: `=A1/B1` where B1 is blank
- Mathematical operations resulting in division by zero

#### `#VALUE!`
- Type mismatch: `=A1+B1` where one contains text
- Function expects number but receives text
- Incompatible array dimensions in array operations

#### `#REF!`
- Referencing deleted rows/columns
- Formula references cells outside sheet bounds
- [[INDIRECT]] creates invalid reference

#### `#NAME?`
- Misspelled function name: `=SUMM(A1:A10)`
- Unquoted text treated as named range
- Reference to non-existent named range

#### `#NUM!`
- Numeric calculation out of range
- Invalid argument to mathematical function
- Iteration limit exceeded in iterative calculations

#### `#N/A`
- [[VLOOKUP]], [[HLOOKUP]], [[MATCH]] find no match
- Explicit `=NA()` function call
- Missing value in data set

#### `Loading...`
- Temporary state while formula calculates
- Common with complex recursive formulas or external data sources
- Usually resolves automatically

### Error as Values

In the Google Sheets API, errors are represented as `ErrorValue` objects containing:
- `type` — the error type enum (see table above)
- `message` — localized descriptive message

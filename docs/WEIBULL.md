Returns the value of the Weibull distribution function (or Weibull cumulative distribution function) for a specified shape and scale.

### Sample Usage

```gse
WEIBULL(2.4, 2, 3, TRUE)
WEIBULL(A2,A3,A4,TRUE)
```

### Syntax

```gse
WEIBULL(x, shape, scale, cumulative)
```

- `x` - The input to the Weibull distribution function.
- `shape` - The shape parameter of the Weibull distribution function.

  + `shape` is usually denoted k, and denoted as alpha in other spreadsheet packages.
  + `shape` must be greater than `0`.
- `scale` - The scale parameter of the Weibull distribution function.

  + `scale` is usually denoted lambda in texts, and denoted as beta in other spreadsheet packages.
  + `scale` must be greater than `0`.
- `cumulative` - `TRUE` to use the cumulative distribution function, `FALSE` to use the probability density function.

### Notes

- If `shape` is `1`, `WEIBULL` is equivalent to `EXPONDIST` with `lambda` set to `1/scale`.

Returns the text with the non-printable ASCII characters removed.

### Sample Usage

```gse
CLEAN("AF"&CHAR(31))
```

### Syntax

```gse
CLEAN(text)
```

- `text` - The text whose non-printable characters are to be removed.

### Notes

- This function only removes non-printable ASCII characters. Non-printable Unicode characters that aren’t found in ASCII are not removed.
- Google Sheets does not show non-printable characters in the UI, so using this function will typically not result in any visible changes.

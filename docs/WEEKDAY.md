Returns a number representing the day of the week of the date provided.

### Sample Usage

`WEEKDAY(DATE(1969,7,20))`

`WEEKDAY(A2)`

`WEEKDAY(40909)`

`WEEKDAY(40909,3)`

### Syntax

`WEEKDAY(date, [type])`

* `date` - The date for which to determine the day of the week. Must be a reference to a cell containing a date, a function returning a date type, or a number.
* `type` - **[** OPTIONAL - `1` by default **]** - A number indicating which numbering system to use to represent weekdays. By default counts starting with Sunday = 1.

  + If `type` is `1`, days are counted from Sunday and the value of Sunday is 1, therefore the value of Saturday is 7.
  + If `type` is `2`, days are counted from Monday and the value of Monday is 1, therefore the value of Sunday is 7.
  + If `type` is `3`, days are counted from Monday and the value of Monday is 0, therefore the value of Sunday is 6.

### Notes

* Ensure that the input to the function is either a reference to a cell containing a date, a function which returns a date object such as [[DATE]], [[DATEVALUE]] or [[TO_DATE]], or a date serial number of the type returned by the [[N]] function. Google Sheets represents dates internally as numbers for ease of use in calculation, and while this conversion is done automatically when a date in the form of a string is input into a cell, this function does not perform this conversion.
* `WEEKDAY` does not autoconvert number formats in the same way that Google Sheets does upon direct entry into cells. Therefore, `WEEKDAY(10/10/2000)` is interpreted as `WEEKDAY(0.0005)`, the quotient of 10 divided by 10 divided by 2000.
* `WEEKDAY` returns the day of week in numeric form, not as a letter (e.g. 'M' or 'F') an abbreviation (e.g. 'Tue' or 'Thu') nor as a full day name (e.g. 'Wednesday'). To get the name of the weekday, use the [[TEXT]] function or change the [number formatting](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/56470) on the cell.

Calculates the skewness of a dataset, which describes the symmetry of that dataset about the mean.

### Sample Usage

`SKEW(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)`

`SKEW(A2:A100)`

### Syntax

`SKEW(value1, [value2, ...])`

* `value1` - The first value or range of the dataset.
* `value2, ...` - Additional values or ranges to include in the dataset.

### Notes

* Although `SKEW` is specified as taking a maximum of 30 arguments, Google Sheets supports an arbitrary number of arguments for this function.
* If the total number of values supplied as `value` arguments is not at least two, `SKEW` will return the `#DIV/0!` error.
* Any text encountered in the `value` arguments will be ignored.
* Positive skewness indicates a longer tail extending in the positive direction, to the right of the mean, while negative skewness indicates a longer tail in the negative direction, to the left. Skewness nearer to zero indicates more symmetrical distributions.

The T.DIST.2T function returns the two tailed Student distribution for a value x. Along with `T.DIST.RT`, this function replaces `TDIST` and is equivalent to calling `TDIST` with the tails argument set to 2.

### Syntax
```gse
T.DIST.2T(x, degrees_freedom)
```

| Part | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `x` | Required. The x value to evaluate the distribution at. |
| `degrees_freedom` | Required. The degrees of freedom. |

### Sample formulas

```gse
Example 1: T.DIST.2T(1.96, 60)
Example 2: T.DIST.2T(1, 2)
```

### Notes

- If deg\_freedom is less than 1, returns an #NUM error.
- If x is negative, returns an #NUM error.
- Along with `T.DIST.RT`, this formula replaces the `TDIST` formula. This is equivalent to calling the `TDIST` formula with tails = 2.

### Examples

Result for A1=`T.DIST.2T(1.96, 60)`

| A | B |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | 0.054644929736529 |  |
| **2** |  |  |

Result for A1=`T.DIST.2T(1, 2)`

| A | B |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | 0.42264973081037 |  |
| **2** |  |  |

Returns a single value from a database table-like array or range using a SQL-like query.

### Sample Usage

```gse
DGET(A2:F20,G2,A22:D23)
DGET(A2:F20,"price",{"Ticker";"Google"})
```

### Syntax

```gse
DGET(database, field, criteria)
```

- `database` - The array or range containing the data to consider, structured in such a way that the first row contains the labels for each column's values.
- `field` - Indicates which column in `database` contains the values to be extracted and operated on.

  + `field` may either be a text label corresponding to a column header in the first row of `database` or a numeric index indicating which column to consider, where the first column has the value `1`.
- `criteria` - An array or range containing zero or more criteria to filter the `database` values by before operating.

### Notes

- Detailed information about database functions and constructing queries around criteria can be found in the [Database Functions help article](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/173497).
- `DGET` is the only database function which does not aggregate - it will return an error if the filtered data has either no matching elements or more than one matching element.

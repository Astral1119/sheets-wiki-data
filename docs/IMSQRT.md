The `IMSQRT` function computes the square root of a complex number.

### Syntax
The `IMSQRT` formula is formatted as `=IMSQRT(complex_number).`

| **Part** | **Description** | **Notes** |
| complex\_number | The complex number to take the square root of. |  |

### Sample formulas

```gse
IMSQRT(2)
IMSQRT("3+2i")
```

### Notes

- This function is equivalent to using `IMPOWER(complex_number, 0.5).`
- While it is not possible to use the `SQRT` function to take the square root of a negative real number, it is possible to use `IMSQRT` to take the square root of a complex number with a negative real number component.

### Examples

|  | A | B |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Formula** | **Result** |
| 2 | `=IMSQRT(4)` | 2 |
| 3 | `=IMSQRT("3+4i")` | 2+i |
| 4 | `=IMSQRT("3-4j")` | 2-j |
| 5 | `=IMSQRT(COMPLEX(3, 4))` | 2+i |

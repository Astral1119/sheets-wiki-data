Calculates the price of a US Treasury Bill based on discount rate.

### Sample Usage

`TBILLPRICE(DATE(2010,1,2), DATE(2010,12,31), .0125)`

`TBILLPRICE(A2,B2,C2)`

### Syntax

`TBILLPRICE(settlement, maturity, discount)`

* `settlement` - The settlement date of the security, the date after issuance when the security is delivered to the buyer.
* `maturity` - The maturity or end date of the security, when it can be redeemed at face or par value.
* `discount` - The discount rate of the bill at time of purchase.

### Notes

* `settlement` and `maturity` should be entered using `DATE`, `TO_DATE` or other date parsing functions rather than by entering text.
* `TBILLPRICE` is equivalent to using `PRICEDISC` with US Treasury Bill conventions for the absent parameters.
* `maturity` must be one year or less from the `settlement` date.
* `discount` is a percentage and must be entered as a positive number from zero to one.

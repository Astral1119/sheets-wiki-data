The SUMPRODUCT function calculates the sum of the products of corresponding entries in 2 equally sized arrays or ranges.

### Sample Usage

```gse
SUMPRODUCT(A2:C5,D2:F5)
SUMPRODUCT({1,2,3,4},{5,6,7,8})
```

### Syntax

```gse
SUMPRODUCT(array1, [array2, ...])
```

- `array1` - The first array or range whose entries will be multiplied with corresponding entries in the second such array or range.
- `array2, ...`  - **[** OPTIONAL - `{1,1,1,...}` with same length as `array1` by default **]** - The second array or range whose entries will be multiplied with corresponding entries in the first such array or range.

### Notes

- Matrix multiplication, `MMULT`, can also be accomplished using a combination of `TRANSPOSE` and `SUMPRODUCT` functions.

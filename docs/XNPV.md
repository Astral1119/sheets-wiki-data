Calculates the net present value of an investment based on a specified series of potentially irregularly spaced cash flows and a discount rate.

### Sample Usage

```gse
XNPV(A2,B2:B25,C2:C25)
XNPV(0.08,{200,250,300},{DATE(2012,06,23),DATE(2013,05,12),DATE(2014,02,09)})
```

### Syntax

```gse
XNPV(discount, cashflow_amounts, cashflow_dates)
```

- `discount` - The discount rate of the investment over one period.
- `cashflow_amounts` - A range of cells containing the income or payments associated with the investment.
- `cashflow_dates` - A range of cells with dates corresponding to the cash flows in `cashflow_amounts`.

### Notes

- `XNPV` is similar to `PV` except that `XNPV` allows variable-value cash flows and cash flow intervals.
- If the days specified in `cashflow_dates` are at a regular interval, use `NPV` instead.
- Each cell in `cashflow_amounts` should be positive if it represents income from the perspective of the owner of the investment (e.g. coupons) or negative if it represents payments (e.g. loan repayment).
- `XIRR` under the same conditions calculates the internal rate of return for which the net present value is zero.

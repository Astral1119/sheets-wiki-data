Calculates the standard deviation based on a sample, setting text to the value `0`.

### Sample Usage

```gse
STDEVA(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
STDEVA(A2:A100)
```

### Syntax

```gse
STDEVA(value1, [value2, ...])
```

- `value1` - The first value or range of the sample.
- `value2, ...` - Additional values or ranges to include in the sample.

### Notes

- Although `STDEVA` is specified as taking a maximum of 30 arguments, Google Sheets supports an arbitrary number of arguments for this function.
- If the total number of values supplied as `value` arguments is not at least two, `STDEVA` will return the `#DIV/0!` error.
- `STDEVA` sets each text value encountered to `0` for the purpose of calculation.
- `STDEVA` calculates standard deviation for a sample. To calculate standard deviation across an entire population, use `STDEVPA`.
- `STDEVA` is equivalent to the square root of the variance, or `SQRT(VARA(...))` using the same dataset.

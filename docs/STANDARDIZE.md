Calculates the normalized equivalent of a random variable given mean and standard deviation of the distribution.

### Sample Usage

`STANDARDIZE(96,80,6.7)`

`STANDARDIZE(A2,A3,A4)`

### Syntax

`STANDARDIZE(value, mean, standard_deviation)`

* `value` - The value of the random variable to normalize.
* `mean` - The mean of the distribution.
* `standard_deviation` - The standard deviation of the distribution.

### Notes

* For a given dataset, `mean` can be calculated using `AVERAGE` or its related functions and `standard_deviation` can be calculated using `STDEV` or its related functions.

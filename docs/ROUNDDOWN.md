The ROUNDDOWN function rounds a number to a certain number of decimal places, always rounding down to the next valid increment.

### Sample Usage

```gse
ROUNDDOWN(99.44,1)
ROUNDDOWN(A2)
```

### Syntax

```gse
ROUNDDOWN(value,[places])
```

- `value` - The value to round to `places` number of places, always rounding down.
- `places` - **[** OPTIONAL - `0` by default **]** - The number of decimal places to which to round.

  + `places` may be negative, in which case `value` is rounded at the specified number of digits to the left of the decimal point.

### Notes

- `ROUNDDOWN` operates like `ROUND` except that it always rounds down.

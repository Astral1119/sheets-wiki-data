Returns the number of ways to choose some number of objects from a pool of a given size of objects, considering order.

### Sample Usage

`PERMUT(4,2)`

`PERMUT(A2,B2)`

### Syntax

`PERMUT(n, k)`

* `n` - The size of the pool of objects to choose from.
* `k` - The number of objects to choose.

### Notes

* `PERMUT` is the standard combinatorics function typically notated nPk. This is similar to `COMBIN` except in permutations, the order of selection is considered rather than simply the resultant selected subset.

Calculates the covariance of a dataset.

### Sample Usage

`COVAR(A2:A100,B2:B100)`

### Syntax

`COVAR(data_y, data_x)`

* `data_y` - The range representing the array or matrix of dependent data.
* `data_x` - The range representing the array or matrix of independent data.

### Notes

* Any text encountered in the `value` arguments will be ignored.
* Positive covariance indicates that the independent data and dependent data tend to change together in the same direction; negative indicates that they tend to change together in the opposite direction (i.e. increase in one leads to decrease in the other). The magnitude of covariance is difficult to interpret - use `CORREL` or `PEARSON`, the normalized version of `COVAR`, to gauge strength of linear correlation.

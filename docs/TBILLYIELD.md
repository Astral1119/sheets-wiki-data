Calculates the yield of a US Treasury Bill based on price.

### Sample Usage

```gse
TBILLYIELD(DATE(2010,1,2), DATE(2010,12,31), 98.45)
TBILLYIELD(A2,B2,C2)
```

### Syntax

```gse
TBILLYIELD(settlement, maturity, price)
```

- `settlement` - The settlement date of the security, the date after issuance when the security is delivered to the buyer.
- `maturity` - The maturity or end date of the security, when it can be redeemed at face or par value.
- `price` - The price at which the security is bought.

### Notes

- `TBILLYIELD` requires the maturity date to be no more than a year after the settlement date.
- `settlement` and `maturity` should be entered using `DATE`, `TO_DATE` or other date parsing functions rather than by entering text.
- `TBILLYIELD` is equivalent to using `YIELDDISC` with US Treasury Bill conventions for the absent parameters.

Some functions from other spreadsheet programs don't work in Sheets, but are reserved as built-in function names. One implication of this is that you cannot create [[Named function|named functions]] with these names.

|                    |
| ------------------ |
| CALL               |
| CUBEKPIMEMBER      |
| CUBEMEMBER         |
| CUBEMEMBERPROPERTY |
| CUBERANKEDMEMBER   |
| CUBESET            |
| CUBESETCOUNT       |
| CUBEVALUE          |
| INFO               |
| REGISTER.ID        |
| RTD                |
| WEBSERVICE         |

Each of these functions returns `#NAME?` with the error text:

> This function is not fully supported in Sheets. Please see the help center for more information.

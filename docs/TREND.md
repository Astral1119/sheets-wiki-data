Given partial data about a linear trend, fits an ideal linear trend using the least squares method and/or predicts further values.

### Sample Usage

```gse
TREND(B2:B10,A2:A10)
TREND(B2:B10,A2:A10,A11:A13,TRUE)
```

### Syntax

```gse
TREND(known_data_y, [known_data_x], [new_data_x], [b])
```

- `known_data_y` - The array or range containing dependent (y) values that are already known, used to curve fit an ideal linear trend.

  + If `known_data_y` is a two-dimensional array or range, `known_data_x` must have the same dimensions or be omitted.
  + If `known_data_y` is a one-dimensional array or range, `known_data_x` may represent multiple independent variables in a two-dimensional array or range. I.e. if `known_data_y` is a single row, each row in `known_data_x` is interpreted as a separated independent value, and analogously if `known_data_y` is a single column.
- `known_data_x` - **[** OPTIONAL - `{1,2,3,...}` with same length as `known_data_y` by default **]** - The values of the independent variable(s) corresponding with `known_data_y`.

  + If `known_data_y` is a one-dimensional array or range, `known_data_x` may represent multiple independent variables in a two-dimensional array or range. I.e. if `known_data_y` is a single row, each row in `known_data_x` is interpreted as a separated independent value, and analogously if `known_data_y` is a single column.
- `new_data_x` - **[** OPTIONAL - same as `known_data_x` by default **]** - The data points to return the `y` values for on the ideal curve fit.

  + The default behavior is to return the ideal curve fit values for the same `x` inputs as the existing data for comparison of known `y` values and their corresponding curve fit estimates.
- `b` - **[** OPTIONAL - `TRUE` by default **]** - Given a general exponential form of `y = m*x+b` for a curve fit, calculates `b` if `TRUE` or forces `b` to be `0` and only calculates the `m` values if `FALSE`, i.e. forces the curve fit to pass through the origin.

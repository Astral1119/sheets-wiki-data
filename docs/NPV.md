Calculates the net present value of an investment based on a series of periodic cash flows and a discount rate.

### Sample Usage

```gse
NPV(0.08,200,250,300)
NPV(A2,A3,A4,A5)
```

### Syntax

```gse
NPV(discount, cashflow1, [cashflow2, ...])
```

- `discount` - The discount rate of the investment over one period.
- `cashflow1` - The first future cash flow.
- `cashflow2, ...` - **[** OPTIONAL **]** - Additional future cash flows.

### Notes

- `NPV` is similar to `PV` except that `NPV` allows variable-value cash flows.
- Each `cashflow` argument should be positive if it represents income from the perspective of the owner of the investment (e.g. coupons) or negative if it represents payments (e.g. loan repayment).
- Each `cashflow` argument may be either a value, a reference to a value, or a range containing values. Cashflows are considered in the order they are referenced.
- `IRR` under the same conditions calculates the internal rate of return for which the net present value is zero.
- If the cash flows of an investment are irregularly spaced, use `XNPV` instead.

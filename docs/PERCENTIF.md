Returns the percentage of a range that meets a condition.

### Parts of a PERCENTIF function

PERCENTIF(range, criterion)

| Part | Description |
| --- | --- |
| range | The range that is tested against `criterion`. |
| criterion | The pattern or test to apply to `range`. |

### Sample Usage

PERCENTIF(A1:A10, ">20")

PERCENTIF(A1:A10, "Paid")

### Notes

- If `range` contains text to check against, `criterion` must be a string. `criterion` can contain wildcards including ? to match any single character or \* to match zero or more contiguous characters. To match an actual question mark or asterisk, prefix the character with the tilde (~) character (i.e. ~? and ~\*). A string criterion must be enclosed in quotation marks. Each cell in `range` is then checked against `criterion` for equality (or match, if wildcards are used).
- If `range` contains numbers to check against, `criterion` may be either a string or a number. If a number is provided, each cell in `range` is checked for equality with `criterion`. Otherwise, `criterion` may be a string containing a number (which also checks for equality), or a number prefixed with any of the following operators:  `=, >, >=, <, or <=,` which check whether the range cell is equal to, greater than, greater than or equal to, less than, or less than or equal to the criterion value, respectively.
- PERCENTIF supports only evaluating a single criterion.

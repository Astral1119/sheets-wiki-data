Returns the current date as a date value.

### Sample Usage

```gse
TODAY()
```

### Syntax

```gse
TODAY()
```

### Notes

- Note that `TODAY` is a volatile function and can hurt spreadsheet performance.
- `TODAY` provides the current date with no time component. To create a date with the current time, use [[NOW]].
- `TODAY` will always represent the current date the last time the spreadsheet was recalculated, rather than remaining at the date when it was first entered.

### See Also

[[DATEVALUE]]: Converts a provided date string in a known format to a date value.

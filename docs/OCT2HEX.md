The OCT2HEX function converts a signed octal number to signed hexadecimal format.

### Sample Usage

```gse
OCT2HEX(37,8)
OCT2HEX(A2)
```

### Syntax

```gse
OCT2HEX(signed_octal_number, [significant_digits])
```

- `signed_octal_number` - The signed 30-bit octal value to be converted to signed hexadecimal, provided as a string.

  + The most significant bit of `signed_octal_number` is the sign bit; that is, negative numbers are represented in two's complement format.
  + For this function, this value has a maximum of 3777777777 if positive, and a minimum of 4000000000 if negative.
  + If `signed_octal_number` is provided as a valid octal number, it will automatically be converted to the appropriate string input. For example, `OCT2HEX(177)` and `OCT2HEX("177")` yield the same result: `7F`.
- `significant_digits` - **[** OPTIONAL **]** - The number of significant digits to ensure in the result.

  + If this is greater than the number of significant digits in the result, the result is left-padded with zeros until the total number of digits reaches `significant_digits`.
  + This value is ignored if the most significant bit of `signed_octal_number` is `1`; that is, if the expressed `signed_octal_number` is greater than or equal to 4000000000.

### Notes

- As with any octal value, only the digits 0-7 are valid. Digits outside of this will cause `OCT2HEX` to return a `#NUM!` error.
- If the number of digits required is greater than the specified `significant_digits`, the `#NUM!` error is returned.

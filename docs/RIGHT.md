Returns a substring from the end of a specified string.

### Sample Usage

```gse
RIGHT(A2,2)
RIGHT("lorem ipsum")
```

### Syntax

```gse
RIGHT(string, [number_of_characters])
```

- `string` - The string from which the right portion will be returned.
- `number_of_characters` - **[** OPTIONAL - `1` by default **]** - The number of characters to return from the right side of `string`.

### Notes

- `0` is a valid input for `number_of_characters` and will cause `RIGHT` to return the empty string.

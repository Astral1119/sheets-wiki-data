The DECIMAL function converts the text representation of a number in another base, to base 10 (decimal).

### Syntax
```gse
DECIMAL(value, base)
```

| Part | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `value` | The unsigned value to be converted to decimal, provided as a string. |  |
| `base` | The base (or radix) to convert the number into. | The base is an integer from 2 to 36. |

### Sample formula

```gse
DECIMAL(101,2)
```

### Notes

- The string representation of the value is used, which should only contain numeric characters (i.e. scientific notation isn't permitted). The text of a string should be no longer than 255 characters.
- The DECIMAL function only converts to positive integers.

### Example

| A | B |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | **Formula** | **Result** |
| **2** | =DECIMAL(101,2) | 5 |

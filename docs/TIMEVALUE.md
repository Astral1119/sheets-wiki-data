### Syntax

`TIMEVALUE(time_string)`

* `time_string` - The string that holds the time representation.

### Notes

* The string of text used in `time_string` should be within quotations and represent time using either the 12-hour or 24-hour time format, for example "2:15 PM" or "14:15".
* Returns a number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). Zero corresponds to 12:00:00 AM and 0.9999884259 corresponds to 11:59:59 PM. To get closer to 1.0, use fractions of seconds after 11:59:59 PM (e.g., 11:59:59.50 PM).
* Dates, for example the day of the week, are ignored in `time_string`.

Returns the probability associated with an F-test for equality of variances. Determines whether two samples are likely to have come from populations with the same variance.

### Sample Usage

`FTEST(A1:A5, B1:B5)`

`FTEST(A1:D3, A5:D7)`

### Syntax

`FTEST(range1, range2)`

* `range1` - The first sample of data or group of cells to consider for the F-test.
* `range2` - The second sample of data or group of cells to consider for the F-test.

### Notes

* Any non-numeric cells in either range are ignored in the calculation.
* You can use `FTEST` or `F.TEST` to perform this function.

[[CHITEST]]: Returns the probability associated with a Pearson’s chi-squared test on the two ranges of data. Determines the likelihood that the observed categorical data is drawn from an expected distribution.

[[FDIST]]: Calculates the right-tailed F probability distribution (degree of diversity) for two data sets with given input x. Alternately called Fisher-Snedecor distribution or Snedecor's F distribution.

[[FINV]]: Calculates the inverse of the right-tailed F probability distribution. Also called the Fisher-Snedecor distribution or Snedecor’s F distribution.

[[TTEST]]: Returns the probability associated with t-test. Determines whether two samples are likely to have come from the same two underlying populations that have the same mean.

### Example

Suppose you want to determine whether exam scores from this semester have a different variability than last semester. Pass the scores from each semester as arguments to `FTEST`. Because the p-value is high, we can conclude that there is not a significant difference in variability in exam scores.

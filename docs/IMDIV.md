Returns one complex number divided by another.

### Sample Usage

```gse
IMDIV("11+16i", "3+2i")
IMDIV("4+2j", 2)
```

### Syntax

```gse
IMDIV(dividend, divisor)
```

- `dividend` - The complex number to be divided.
- `divisor` - The complex number to divide by.

### Notes

- The division between two complex numbers is defined as follows:

- You can divide two complex numbers only if they have the same suffix (i or j). For example, you can't do `IMDIV("4+3i", "1+2j")`.

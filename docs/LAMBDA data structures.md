While Google Sheets natively supports [[Array|arrays]]. We can simulate structures such as [binary search trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree) or [singly-linked lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) using [[LAMBDA]]. Note that in this context, 'data structure' refers to the computer science concept; in conventional spreadsheet contexts, the term typically refers to conventions for information arrangement and processing, such as with [tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_(information)).

Unlike other programming languages, data structures are a subset of [[LAMBDA UDT|LAMBDA UDTs]].

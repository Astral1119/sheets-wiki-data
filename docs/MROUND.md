Rounds one number to the nearest integer multiple of another.

### Sample Usage

```gse
MROUND(21,14)
MROUND(A2,3)
```

### Syntax

```gse
MROUND(value,factor)
```

- `value` - The number to round to the nearest integer multiple of another.
- `factor` - The number to whose multiples `value` will be rounded.

### Notes

- Both `value` and `factor` may be non-integral.
- `value` and `factor` must have the same sign; that is, they must both be positive or both negative. If either is zero, `MROUND` will return `0`.
- If `value` is equally close to two multiples of `factor`, the multiple with the greater absolute value will be returned.

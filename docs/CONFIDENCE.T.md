The CONFIDENCE.T function calculates the width of half the confidence interval for a student's t-distribution.

Parts of a CONFIDENCE.T function
--------------------------------

`CONFIDENCE.T(alpha, standard_deviation, size)`

| Part | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `alpha` | One minus the desired confidence level. E.g. `0.1`for `0.9`, or 90%, confidence. |
| `standard_deviation` | The standard deviation of the population. |
| `size` | The size of the population. |

Note
----

`CONFIDENCE.T` calculates the width of half the confidence interval such that a value picked at random from the data set has `1-alpha` probability of lying within the mean plus or minus the result of `CONFIDENCE.T`.

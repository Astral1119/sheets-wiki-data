A follow-up from [[Data Structure For Success]] tables are extremely beneficial for maintaining and enabling good data structure.

First we have the ability to constrain data types which allows us to ensure data entry is correctly formatted. Common errors such as numbers as text are easily identifiable. 

Next we have structured references which act similar to named ranges which can help with formula construction.

Tables also have filter views and aggregations such as group by in case you want to view data without manipulating the actual data itself. You can also group, filter, or sort by color within a table format which would otherwise be unavailable easily to us.

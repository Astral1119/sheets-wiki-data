The COMPLEX function creates a complex number, given real and imaginary coefficients.

### Sample Usage

```gse
COMPLEX(3, 4)
COMPLEX(3, -1, "j")
COMPLEX(3, 0)
```

### Syntax

```gse
COMPLEX(real_part, imaginary_part, [suffix])
```

- `real_part` - The real coefficient.
- `imaginary_part` - The imaginary coefficient.
- `suffix` - [ OPTIONAL "`i`" by default] The suffix for the imaginary coefficient.

### See Also

- [[IMAGINARY]]: Returns the imaginary coefficient of a complex number.

Calculates the probability of drawing a certain number of successes (or a maximum number of successes) in a certain number of tries given a population of a certain size containing a certain number of successes, with replacement of draws.

### Sample Usage

```gse
BINOMDIST(4,100,0.005,FALSE)
BINOMDIST(A2,A3,A4,TRUE)
```

### Syntax

```gse
BINOMDIST(num_successes, num_trials, prob_success, cumulative)
```

- `num_successes` - The number of successes for which to calculate the probability in `num_trials` trials.

  + If `cumulative` is `TRUE` then `BINOMDIST` returns the probability of `num_successes` or fewer successes, otherwise the probability of exactly `num_successes` successes.
- `num_trials` - The number of independent trials.
- `prob_success` - The probability of success in any given trial.
- `cumulative` - **[** `FALSE` by default **]** - Whether to use the binomial cumulative distribution.

### Notes

- `HYPGEOMDIST` describes the probability of drawing a certain number of successes in a certain number of tries given a population of a certain size containing a certain number of successes, *without* replacement of draws.

The COVARIANCE.S function calculates the covariance of a dataset, where the dataset is a sample of the total population.

### Parts of a COVARIANCE.S function

```gse
COVARIANCE.S(data_y, data_x)
```

| Part | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `data_y` | The range representing the array or matrix of dependent data. |
| `data_x` | The range representing the array or matrix of independent data. |

### Sample formulas

```gse
COVARIANCE.S(A1:A10)
COVARIANCE.S(1, 2, 3, 4)
COVARIANCE.S(B1:B5, 10)
```

### Notes

- Any text encountered in the `value` arguments will be ignored.
- Positive covariance indicates that the independent data and dependent data tend to change together in the same direction.
- Negative covariance indicates that they tend to change together in the opposite direction. An increase in one leads to a decrease in the other. The magnitude of covariance is difficult to interpret.

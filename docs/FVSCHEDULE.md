The FVSCHEDULE function calculates the future value of some principal based on a specified series of potentially varying interest rates.

### Sample Usage

```gse
FVSCHEDULE(10000,A2:A100)
FVSCHEDULE(10000,{0.1,0.95,0.9,0.85})
FVSCHEDULE(A2,B2:B20)
```

### Syntax

```gse
FVSCHEDULE(principal, rate_schedule)
```

- `principal` - The amount of initial capital or value to compound against.
- `rate_schedule` - A series of interest rates to compound against the `principal`.

  + `rate_schedule` must be either a range or array containing the interest rates to compound, in sequence. These should be expressed either as decimals or as percentages using `UNARY_PERCENT`, i.e. `0.09` or `UNARY_PERCENT(9)` rather than `9`.

Calculates the variance based on a sample.

VAR for BigQuery

Calculates the sample variance of a data column.

### Sample Usage

```gse
=VAR(table_name!price)
```

### Syntax

```gse
VAR(column)
```

- `column` - The data column of the sample.

**Tip**: Returning sample variance across multiple columns is not supported.

### Sample Usage

```gse
VAR(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
VAR(A2:A100)
```

### Syntax

```gse
VAR(value1, [value2, ...])
```

- `value1` - The first value or range of the sample.
- `value2, ...` - Additional values or ranges to include in the sample.

### Notes

- Although `VAR` is specified as taking a maximum of 30 arguments, Google Sheets supports an arbitrary number of arguments for this function.
- If the total number of values supplied as `value` arguments is not at least two, `VAR` will return the `#DIV/0!​` error.
- `VAR` will return an error if all of the `value` arguments are text. To calculate variance while interpreting text values as `0`, use `VARA`.
- `VAR` calculates variance for a sample. To calculate variance across an entire population, use `VARP`.
- `VAR` takes the sum of the squares of each value's deviation from the mean and divides by the number of such values minus one. This differs from the calculation of variance across an entire population in that the latter divides by the size of the dataset without subtracting one.

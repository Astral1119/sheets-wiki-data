Returns the number of net working days between two provided days excluding specified weekend days and holidays.

### Sample Usage

```gse
NETWORKDAYS.INTL(DATE(1969, 7, 16), DATE(1969, 7, 24), 1, A1:A10)
NETWORKDAYS.INTL(DATE(1969, 7, 16), DATE(1969, 7, 24))
NETWORKDAYS.INTL("12/04/1995", "12/22/1995", 3)
NETWORKDAYS.INTL("12/04/1995", "12/22/1995", “0000011”)
```

### Syntax

```gse
NETWORKDAYS.INTL(start_date, end_date, [weekend], [holidays])
```

- `start_date` - The start date of the period from which to calculate the number of net working days.
- `end_date` - The end date of the period from which to calculate the number of net working days.
- `weekend` - **[** OPTIONAL - `1` by default **]** - A number or string representing which days of the week are considered weekends.
  + **String method**: weekends can be specified using seven 0’s and 1’s, where the first number in the set represents Monday and the last number is for Sunday. A zero means that the day is a work day, a 1 means that the day is a weekend. For example, “0000011” would mean Saturday and Sunday are weekends.
  + **Number method**: instead of using the string method above, a single number can be used. 1 = Saturday/Sunday are weekends, 2 = Sunday/Monday, and this pattern repeats until 7 = Friday/Saturday. 11 = Sunday is the only weekend, 12 = Monday is the only weekend, and this pattern repeats until 17 = Saturday is the only weekend.
- `holidays` - **[** OPTIONAL **]** - A range or array constant containing the dates to consider as holidays.
  + The values provided within an array for `holidays` must be date serial number values, as returned by [[N]] or date values, as returned by [[DATE]], [[DATEVALUE]] or [[TO_DATE]]. Values specified by a range should be standard date values or date serial numbers.

### Notes

- `NETWORKDAYS.INTL` does not autoconvert number formats in the same way that Google Sheets does upon direct entry into cells. Therefore, `NETWORKDAYS.INTL(10/10/2000,10/10/2001)` is interpreted as `NETWORKDAYS.INTL(0.005,0.00499750124938)`, the quotients of 10 divided by 10 divided by 2000 and 2001, respectively.
- `NETWORKDAYS.INTL` calculates the number of work days between two dates. To calculate the working days a specific number of days ahead of a date, use [[WORKDAY.INTL]].
- `NETWORKDAYS.INTL` works similarly to `NETWORKDAYS` but also allows weekend days to be specified (for areas where Saturday and Sunday are not considered the weekend).

Given partial data about an exponential growth curve, calculates various parameters about the best fit ideal exponential growth curve.

### Sample Usage

`LOGEST(B2:B10,A2:A10)`

`LOGEST(B2:B10, A2:A10, TRUE, TRUE)`

### Syntax

`LOGEST(known_data_y, [known_data_x], [b], [verbose])`

* `known_data_y` - The array or range containing dependent (y) values that are already known, used to curve fit an ideal exponential growth curve.

  + If `known_data_y` is a two-dimensional array or range, `known_data_x` must have the same dimensions or be omitted.
  + If `known_data_y` is a one-dimensional array or range, `known_data_x` may represent multiple independent variables in a two-dimensional array or range. I.e. if `known_data_y` is a single row, each row in `known_data_x` is interpreted as a separated independent value, and analogously if `known_data_y` is a single column.
* `known_data_x` - **[** OPTIONAL - `{1,2,3,...}` with same length as `known_data_y` by default **]** - The values of the independent variable(s) corresponding with `known_data_y`.

  + If `known_data_y` is a one-dimensional array or range, `known_data_x` may represent multiple independent variables in a two-dimensional array or range. I.e. if `known_data_y` is a single row, each row in `known_data_x` is interpreted as a separated independent value, and analogously if `known_data_y` is a single column.
* `b` - **[** OPTIONAL - `TRUE` by default **]** - Given a general exponential form of `y = b*m^x` for a curve fit, calculates `b` if `TRUE` or forces `b` to be `1` and only calculates the `m` values if `FALSE`.
* `verbose` - **[** OPTIONAL - `FALSE` by default **]** - A flag specifying whether to return additional regression statistics or only the calculated coefficient and exponents.

  + If `verbose` is `TRUE`, in addition to the set of exponents for each independent variable and the coefficient `b`, `LOGEST` returns

    - The standard error for each exponent and the coefficient,
    - The coefficient of determination (between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates perfect correlation),
    - Standard error for the dependent variable values,
    - The F statistic, or F-observed value indicating whether the observed relationship between dependent and independent variables is random rather than exponential,
    - The degrees of freedom, useful in looking up F statistic values in a reference table to estimate a confidence level,
    - The regression sum of squares, and
    - The residual sum of squares.

### Notes

* The statistics calculated by `LOGEST` are similar to `LINEST` but use the linear model `ln y = x1 ln m1 + ... + xn ln mn + ln b` for each independent variable `x1 ... xn`. Therefore additional statistics such as the standard error must be compared to the natural logarithms of the `m` and `b` values rather than the values themselves.

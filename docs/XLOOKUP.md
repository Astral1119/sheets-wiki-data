The `XLOOKUP` function returns the values in the result range based on the position where a match was found in the lookup range. If no match is found, it returns the closest match.

XLOOKUP for BigQuery

Cross lookup. Returns the values in the data column at the position where a match was found in the search column.

### Sample Usage

```gse
=XLOOKUP("Apple",table_name!fruit,table_name!price)
```

### Syntax

```gse
XLOOKUP(search_key,lookup_range,result_range,missing_value,match_mode)
```

- `search_key`: The value to search for. For example, `42`, `"Cats"`, or `B24`.
- `search_column`: The column to consider for the search.
- `result_column`: The column to consider for the result.
- `missing_value`: [OPTIONAL - `#N/A` by default] The value to return if no match is found.
- `match_mode`: [OPTIONAL - `0` by default] The manner in which to find a match for the search\_key.
  + `0`: For an exact match.
  + `1`: For an exact match or the next value that is greater than the search\_key.
  + `-1`: For an exact match or the next value that is lesser than the search\_key.
  + `2`: For a wildcard match.

**Tip:** `search_mode` isn’t supported in XLOOKUP for BigQuery.

### Sample Usage

`XLOOKUP("Apple", A2:A, E2:E)` to replace `VLOOKUP("Apple", A2:E, 5, FALSE)`

`XLOOKUP("Price", A1:E1, A6:E6)` to replace `HLOOKUP("Price", A1:E6, 6, FALSE)`

`XLOOKUP` where match column is to the right of the output column

`XLOOKUP("Apple", E2:E7, A2:A7)`. The `VLOOKUP` equivalent is `VLOOKUP("Apple", {E2:E7, A2:A7}, 2, FALSE)`

### Syntax

```gse
XLOOKUP(search_key, lookup_range, result_range, missing_value, match_mode, search_mode)
```

- `search_key`: The value to search for. For example, `42`, `"Cats"`, or `B24`.
- `lookup_range`: The range to consider for the search. This range must be a singular row or column.
- `result_range`: The range to consider for the result. This range's row or column size should be the same as the `lookup_range`, depending on how the lookup is done.
- `missing_value`: [OPTIONAL - `#N/A` by default] The value to return if no match is found.
- `match_mode`: [OPTIONAL - `0` by default] The manner in which to find a match for the `search_key`.
  + `0` is for an exact match.
  + `1` is for an exact match or the next value that is greater than the `search_key`.
  + `-1` is for an exact match or the next value that is lesser than the `search_key`.
  + `2` is for a wildcard match.
- `search_mode`: [OPTIONAL - `1` by default] The manner in which to search through the `lookup_range`.
  + `1` is to search from the first entry to the last.
  + `-1` is to search from the last entry to the first.
  + `2` is to search through the range with binary search. The range needs to be sorted in ascending order first.
  + `-2` is to search through the range with binary search. The range needs to be sorted in descending order first.

### Notes

- If `result_range` is more than one row or column, then the output will be the entire row/column at the index a match was found in the `lookup_range`.

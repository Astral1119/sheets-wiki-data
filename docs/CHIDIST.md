Calculates the right-tailed chi-squared distribution, often used in hypothesis testing.

### Sample Usage

```gse
CHIDIST(3.45, 2)
CHIDIST(A2, B2)
```

### Syntax

```gse
CHIDIST(x, degrees_freedom)
```

- `x` - The input to the chi-squared probability distribution function. The value at which to evaluate the function.

  + Must be a positive number.
- `degrees_freedom` - The number of degrees of freedom of the distribution.

### Notes

- `degrees_freedom` is truncated to an integer if a non-integer is provided.
- `degrees_freedom` must be at least `1` and may not exceed `10^10`.
- All arguments must be numeric.
- `CHIDIST` is synonymous with `CHISQ.DIST.RT`.

[[CHISQ.DIST]]: Calculates the left-tailed chi-squared distribution, often used in hypothesis testing.

[[CHISQ.DIST.RT]]: Calculates the right-tailed chi-squared distribution, which is commonly used in hypothesis testing.

[[CHITEST]]: Returns the probability associated with a Pearson’s chi-squared test on the two ranges of data. Determines the likelihood that the observed categorical data is drawn from an expected distribution.

[[FDIST]]: Calculates the right-tailed F probability distribution (degree of diversity) for two data sets with given input x. Alternately called Fisher-Snedecor distribution or Snedecor's F distribution.

[[GAMMADIST]]: Calculates the gamma distribution, a two-parameter continuous probability distribution.

[[TDIST]]: Calculates the probability for Student's t-distribution with a given input (x).

### Example

Suppose you want to test the fairness of a 6-sided die:

- From several rolls, you obtain a chi-squared statistic of `12.3`.
- The number of degrees of freedom is `6 - 1 = 5`.
- We will evaluate the chi-squared distribution with `5` degrees of freedom when x equals `12.3`.

| 1 | x | Degrees freedom | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **2** | 12.3 | 5 | 0.03090046464 |
| **3** | 12.3 | 5 | =CHIDIST(12.3, 5) |
| **4** | 12.3 | 5 | =CHIDIST(A2, B2) |

Calculates the right-tailed chi-squared distribution, often used in hypothesis testing.

### Sample Usage

`CHIDIST(3.45, 2)`

`CHIDIST(A2, B2)`

### Syntax

`CHIDIST(x, degrees_freedom)`

* `x` - The input to the chi-squared probability distribution function. The value at which to evaluate the function.

  + Must be a positive number.
* `degrees_freedom` - The number of degrees of freedom of the distribution.

### Notes

* `degrees_freedom` is truncated to an integer if a non-integer is provided.
* `degrees_freedom` must be at least `1` and may not exceed `10^10`.
* All arguments must be numeric.
* `CHIDIST` is synonymous with `CHISQ.DIST.RT`.

### Example

Suppose you want to test the fairness of a 6-sided die:

* From several rolls, you obtain a chi-squared statistic of `12.3`.
* The number of degrees of freedom is `6 - 1 = 5`.
* We will evaluate the chi-squared distribution with `5` degrees of freedom when x equals `12.3`.

| **3** | 12.3 | 5 | =CHIDIST(12.3, 5) |

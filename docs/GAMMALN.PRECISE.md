Returns the logarithm of a specified Gamma function, base e (Euler's number).

### Sample Usage

```gse
GAMMALN(4)
GAMMALN(A2)
```

### Syntax

```gse
GAMMALN(value)
```

- `value` - The input to the Gamma function. The natural logarithm of Gamma (`value`) will be returned.

  + `value` must be positive.

### Notes

- `GAMMALN` is used for certain types of analysis or as a component to other functions and is rarely used by itself.

This function reduces an array to an accumulated result by application of a `LAMBDA` function to each value.

Sample Usage
------------

`REDUCE(5, A1:A3, LAMBDA(accumulator, current_value, accumulator+current_value))`

`REDUCE(2, A1:A3, LAMBDA(accumulator, current_value, accumulator*current_value))`

Syntax
------

`REDUCE(initial_value, array_or_range, LAMBDA)`

* `initial_value`: The initial `accumulator` value.
* `array_or_range`: An array or range to be reduced.
* `LAMBDA`: A `LAMBDA` that’s applied to each value in `array_or_range` to reduce it.
* **Syntax:** `LAMBDA(name1, name2, formula_expression)`
* **Requirements:**
  + The `LAMBDA` must have exactly 2 `name` arguments along with a `formula_expression` which uses those `names`. The `name1` resolves to the current value in the `accumulator` and `name2` resolves to the `current_value` in `array_or_range`, when applying the `LAMBDA`. The `accumulator` is updated in each step to the intermediate value obtained in the previous step.

Notes
-----

* The passed `LAMBDA` should accept exactly 2 `name` arguments, otherwise an `#N/A` error is returned. These arguments correspond to `accumulator` and `current_value`, in order. These are explained as:
  + `name1`: Resolves to the current value in the `accumulator`.
  + `name2`: Resolves to the `current_value` in the input array.
* The `accumulator` is initialized by `initial_value` and updated in each step to the intermediate value obtained in the previous step.

* The `current_value` in the input array are found row by row, while the `LAMBDA` is being applied.

* A `named function` can be passed for the `LAMBDA` parameter and behaves like a `LAMBDA` in this case. [Learn more about named functions](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/12504534).
  + The `named function` must follow the `LAMBDA` syntax for `REDUCE` with exactly 2 argument placeholders defined for it.
  + Parenthesis shouldn't follow the `named function.`

Examples
--------

### Simple multiplication operation

Return the product of all elements in A1:A3 and `initial_value`.

**Example data:**

|  | **A** |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | 3 |
| **2** | 2 |
| **3** | 4 |

**Example:** `=REDUCE(5, A1:A3, LAMBDA(accumulator, current_value, accumulator*current_value))`

**How it works:**

Initially, `accumulator` = 5

1. Processing cell A1:

|  |
| --- |
| `accumulator`= 5  `current_value`= 3 |

After processing cell A1:

|  |
| --- |
| `accumulator`= (return value of `LAMBDA`)= 5\*3= 15 |

2. Processing cell A2:

|  |
| --- |
| `accumulator`= 15  `current_value`= 2 |

After processing cell A2:

|  |
| --- |
| `accumulator`= (return value of `LAMBDA`)= 15\*2= 30 |

3. Processing cell A3:

|  |
| --- |
| `accumulator`= 30  `current_value`= 4 |

After processing cell A3:

|  |
| --- |
| `accumulator`= (return value of `LAMBDA`)= 30\*4= 120 |

**Result:**

|  |
| --- |
| 120 |

### Sum if price is greater than or equal to $20

Add all the prices that are greater than or equal to $20.

**Example Data:**

|  | **A** |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | $50 |
| **2** | $10 |
| **3** | $30 |
| **4** | $20 |

**Example:** `=REDUCE(0, A1:A4, LAMBDA(accumulator, price, if(price>=20, accumulator + price, accumulator)))`

**Result:**

|  |
| --- |
| $100 |

### Use a named function as LAMBDA function

Return the end price after increasing it by a certain percentage every period.

**Example Data:**

|  | **A** | **B** | **C** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | 2022 | 10% | Starting Price: |
| **2** | 2023 | 5% | $100 |
| **3** | 2024 | 5% |  |
| **4** | 2025 | 10% |  |

**Example:** `=REDUCE(C2,B1:B4,PRICE_INCREASE)`

**Named function:** `PRICE_INCREASE` is a `named function` which outputs the result after increasing by the percentage value in column B.

**Formula definition:** `=accumulator+accumulator*cell` where `accumulator` and `cell` are argument placeholders defined for `PRICE_INCREASE`.

**Result:**

|  |
| --- |
| 133.4 |

### Use a named function as LAMBDA with 2-dimensional dataset

Find the list of unique employees of the quarter, preserving row-wise order.

**Example data:**

| 1 | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **2** | **2020** | John | Adam | Stacy | Adam |
| **3** | **2021** | Peter | Maurice | John | Kimberly |
| **4** | **2022** | Stacy | Michael | Peter | Adam |

**Named function:** `ADD_IF_NOT_PRESENT` is a `named function` which adds a given string value to an array of values.

**Function definition:** `=IF(CONTAINS(new_value, existing_values), existing_values, {existing_values, new_value})`, where `existing_values` and `new_value` are argument placeholders defined for `ADD_IF_NOT_PRESENT` in that order, and `CONTAINS` is another `named function`.

**Example:** `=REDUCE({B2}, B2:E4, ADD_IF_NOT_PRESENT)`

**Result:**

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| John | Adam | Stacy | Peter | Maurice | Kimberly | Michael |

Common Errors
-------------

The passed LAMBDA doesn't have exactly 2 name arguments

If the `LAMBDA` function doesn’t have 2 `name` arguments, this error occurs:

“Wrong number of arguments to LAMBDA. Expected 3 arguments, but got 2 arguments.”

**Example:** `=REDUCE(5, C1:C4, LAMBDA(current_value, current_value+1))`

In this example, `LAMBDA` was given only 1 `name` argument when it needed 2.

The last parameter of REDUCE wasn’t a LAMBDA

If the last parameter of `REDUCE` function wasn’t a `LAMBDA` function, this error occurs:

“Argument must be a LAMBDA.”

**Example:** `=REDUCE(5, C1:C4, 3)`

In this example the last function is `3`, instead of a `LAMBDA` function.

The LAMBDA passed to REDUCE was incorrect

If 1 or more `name` arguments aren’t valid, this error occurs:

“Argument 1 of function LAMBDA is not a valid name.”

**Example:** `=REDUCE(5, C1:C4, LAMBDA(C1, v, C1+v))`

In this example, `C1` is an invalid `name` since it clashes with a range.

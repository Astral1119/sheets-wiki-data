Looks through a sorted row or column for a key and returns the value of the cell in a result range located in the same position as the search row or column.

### Sample Usage

`LOOKUP(10003, A1:A100, B1:B100)`

`LOOKUP(10003, A1:B100)`

`LOOKUP("foo", A1:Z10)`

### Syntax

`LOOKUP(search_key, search_range|search_result_array, [result_range])`

* `search_key` - The value to search for in the row or column. For example, 42, "Cats", or I24.
* `search_range|search_result_array` - One method of using `LOOKUP` is to provide a single row or column `search_range` to look through for the search with a second argument `result_range`. The other way is to combine these two arguments into one `search_result_array` where the first row or column is searched and a value is returned from the last row or column in the array.
* `result_range` - **[** OPTIONAL **]** - The range from which to return a result. The value returned corresponds to the location where `search_key` is found in `search_range`. This range must be only a single row or column and should not be used if using the `search_result_array` method.

### Notes

The `LOOKUP` function will only work properly if data in `search_range` or `search_result_array` is sorted. Use `VLOOKUP`, `HLOOKUP`, or other related functions if data is not sorted.

If `search_key` is not found, the item used in the lookup will be the value thatâ€™s immediately smaller in the range provided. For example, if the data set contains the numbers 1, 3, 5 and `search_key` is 2, then 1 will be used for the lookup.

In the `search_result_array` method, the last row or column in the provided range is returned. If a different row or column is desired, use `VLOOKUP` or `HLOOKUP` instead.

When using the `search_result_array` method, if the range provided contains more columns than rows, then the search will be from left to right over the first row in the range. If the range contains an equal number of rows and columns or more rows than columns, then the search will be from top to bottom over the first column in the range.

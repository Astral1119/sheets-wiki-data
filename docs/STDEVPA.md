Calculates the standard deviation based on an entire population, setting text to the value `0`.

### Sample Usage

`STDEVPA(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)`

`STDEVPA(A2:A100)`

### Syntax

`STDEVPA(value1, [value2, ...])`

* `value1` - The first value or range of the population.
* `value2, ...` - Additional values or ranges to include in the population.

### Notes

* Although `STDEVPA` is specified as taking a maximum of 30 arguments, Google Sheets supports an arbitrary number of arguments for this function.
* If the total number of values supplied as `value` arguments is not at least two, `STDEVPA` will return the `#DIV/0!` error.
* `STDEVPA` sets each text value encountered to `0` for the purpose of calculation. To return an error upon encountering text, use `STDEVP`.
* `STDEVPA` calculates standard deviation for an entire population. To calculate standard deviation across a sample, use `STDEV`.
* `STDEVPA` is equivalent to the square root of the variance, or `SQRT(VARPA(...))` using the same dataset.

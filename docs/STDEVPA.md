Calculates the standard deviation based on an entire population, setting text to the value `0`.

### Sample Usage

```gse
STDEVPA(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
STDEVPA(A2:A100)
```

### Syntax

```gse
STDEVPA(value1, [value2, ...])
```

- `value1` - The first value or range of the population.
- `value2, ...` - Additional values or ranges to include in the population.

### Notes

- Although `STDEVPA` is specified as taking a maximum of 30 arguments, Google Sheets supports an arbitrary number of arguments for this function.
- If the total number of values supplied as `value` arguments is not at least two, `STDEVPA` will return the `#DIV/0!` error.
- `STDEVPA` sets each text value encountered to `0` for the purpose of calculation. To return an error upon encountering text, use `STDEVP`.
- `STDEVPA` calculates standard deviation for an entire population. To calculate standard deviation across a sample, use `STDEV`.
- `STDEVPA` is equivalent to the square root of the variance, or `SQRT(VARPA(...))` using the same dataset.

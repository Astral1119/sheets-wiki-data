Calculates the internal rate of return on an investment based on a series of periodic cash flows.

### Sample Usage

`IRR(A2:A25)`

`IRR({-4000,200,250,300,350},0.1)`

### Syntax

`IRR(cashflow_amounts, [rate_guess])`

* `cashflow_amounts` - An array or range containing the income or payments associated with the investment.

  + `cashflow_amounts` must contain at least one negative and one positive cash flow to calculate rate of return.
* `rate_guess` - **[** OPTIONAL - 0.1 by default **]** - An estimate for what the internal rate of return will be.

### Notes

* Each cell in `cashflow_amounts` should be positive if it represents income from the perspective of the owner of the investment (e.g. coupons) or negative if it represents payments (e.g. loan repayment).
* `NPV` will return zero if `discount` is set to the result of `IRR` using the same cash flow amounts.
* If the cash flows of an investment are irregularly spaced, use `XIRR` instead.

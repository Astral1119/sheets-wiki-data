Calculates the modified internal rate of return on an investment based on a series of periodic cash flows and the difference between the interest rate paid on financing versus the return received on reinvested income.

### Sample Usage

```gse
MIRR(A2:A25,B2,B3)
MIRR({-4000,200,250,300,350},0.08,0.11)
```

### Syntax

```gse
MIRR(cashflow_amounts, financing_rate, reinvestment_return_rate)
```

- `cashflow_amounts` - An array or range containing the income or payments associated with the investment.

  + `cashflow_amounts` must contain at least one negative and one positive cash flow to calculate rate of return.
- `financing_rate` - The interest rate paid on funds invested.
- `reinvestment_return_rate` - The return (as a percentage) earned on reinvestment of income received from the investment.

### Notes

- Each cell in `cashflow_amounts` should be positive if it represents income from the perspective of the owner of the investment (e.g. coupons) or negative if it represents payments (e.g. loan repayment).

The CEILING function rounds a number up to the nearest integer multiple of specified significance.

### Sample Usage

```gse
CEILING(23.25,0.1)
CEILING(A2,1)
```

### Syntax

```gse
CEILING(value, [factor])
```

- `value` - The value to round up to the nearest integer multiple of `factor`.
- `factor` - **[**OPTIONAL: `1` by default**]** - The number to whose multiples `value` will be rounded.

  + `factor` may not be equal to `0`.

### Notes

- When `value` is positive, `factor` must also be positive.
- When `value` is negative, `factor` can be either negative or positive to determine which direction to round.
- `CEILING` is most often used with `factor` set to a "round" number, such as `0.1` or `0.01,` in order to round to a particular decimal place.

Calculates the variance based on an entire population.

VARP for BigQuery

Calculates the population variance of a data column.

Sample Usage
------------

`=VARP(table_name!price)`

Syntax
------

`VARP(column)`

* `column`: The data column of the population.

**Tip**: Returning population variance across multiple columns is not supported.

### Sample Usage

`VARP(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)`

`VARP(A2:A100)`

### Syntax

`VARP(value1, [value2, ...])`

* `value1` - The first value or range of the population.
* `value2, ...` - Additional values or ranges to include in the population.

### Notes

* Although `VARP` is specified as taking a maximum of 30 arguments, Google Sheets supports an arbitrary number of arguments for this function.
* If the total number of values supplied as `value` arguments is not at least two, `VARP` will return the `#DIV/0!` error.
* `VARP` will ignoreÂ any of the `value` arguments that include text. To calculate variance while interpreting text values as `0`, use `VARPA`.
* `VARP` calculates variance for an entire population. To calculate variance across a sample, use `VAR`.
* `VARP` takes the sum of the squares of each value's deviation from the mean and divides by the number of such values. This differs from the calculation of variance across a sample in that the latter divides by the size of the dataset minus one.

Returns the number of net working days between two provided days.

### Sample Usage

```gse
NETWORKDAYS(DATE(1969,7,16),DATE(1969,7,24))
NETWORKDAYS(A2,B2)
NETWORKDAYS(40909,40924)
NETWORKDAYS(40900,40950,{40909,40924})
```

### Syntax

```gse
NETWORKDAYS(start_date, end_date, [holidays])
```

- `start_date` - The start date of the period from which to calculate the number of net working days.
- `end_date` - The end date of the period from which to calculate the number of net working days.
- `holidays` - **[** OPTIONAL **]** - A range or array constant containing the date serial numbers to consider holidays.

  + The values provided within an array for `holidays` must be date serial number values, as returned by [[N]] or date values, as returned by [[DATE]], [[DATEVALUE]] or [[TO_DATE]]. Values specified by a range should be standard date values or date serial numbers.

### Notes

- `NETWORKDAYS` does not autoconvert number formats in the same way that Google Sheets does upon direct entry into cells. Therefore, `NETWORKDAYS(10/10/2000,10/10/2001)` is interpreted as `NETWORKDAYS(0.005,0.00499750124938)`, the quotients of 10 divided by 10 divided by 2000 and 2001, respectively.
- `NETWORKDAYS` calculates the number of work days between two dates. To calculate the working day a specific number of days ahead of a date, use [[WORKDAY]].
- `NETWORKDAYS` works similarly to `NETWORKDAYS.INTL` but only treats Saturday and Sunday as the weekend. Use `NETWORKDAYS.INTL` to use other days of the week as the weekend.

Calculates the y-value at which the line resulting from linear regression of a dataset will intersect the y-axis (x=0).

### Sample Usage

```gse
INTERCEPT(A2:A100,B2:B100)
```

### Syntax

```gse
INTERCEPT(data_y, data_x)
```

- `data_y` - The range representing the array or matrix of dependent data.
- `data_x` - The range representing the array or matrix of independent data.

### Notes

- Any text encountered in the `value` arguments will be ignored.

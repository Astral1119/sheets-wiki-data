Calculates the probability of drawing a certain number of successes in a certain number of tries given a population of a certain size containing a certain number of successes, without replacement of draws.

### Sample Usage

```gse
HYPGEOMDIST(4,12,20,40)
HYPGEOMDIST(A2,A3,A4,A5)
```

### Syntax

```gse
HYPGEOMDIST(num_successes, num_draws, successes_in_pop, pop_size)
```

- `num_successes` - The desired number of successes.
- `num_draws` - The number of permitted draws.
- `successes_in_pop` - The total number of successes in the population.
- `pop_size` - The total size of the population

### Notes

- `BINOMDIST` describes the probability of drawing a certain number of successes in a certain number of tries given a population of a certain size containing a certain number of successes, *with* replacement of draws.

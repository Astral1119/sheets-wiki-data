The IMSEC function returns the secant of the given complex number. For example, a given complex number "x+yi" returns "sec(x+yi)."

### Syntax
```gse
IMSEC(number)
```

| Part | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `number` | The complex number for which you want the secant. | This can be either the result of the COMPLEX function, a real number interpreted as a complex number with imaginary parts equal to 0, or a string in the format “x+yi” where x and y are numeric. |

### Sample formulas

```gse
IMSEC(COMPLEX(4,6))
IMSEC(4)
IMSEC("2+3i")
```

### Notes

The `IMSEC` function returns an error if the given number isn't a valid complex number.

### Examples

| A | B |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | **Formula** | **Result** |
| **2** | `=IMSEC(COMPLEX(4,1))` | -0.557760402867351-0.491827502294509i |
| **3** | `=IMSEC(3.5)` | -1.06785504719181 |
| **4** | `=IMSEC("3+2i")` | -0.263512975158389+0.0362116365587685i |

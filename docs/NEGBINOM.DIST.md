Calculates the probability of drawing a certain number of failures before a certain number of successes given a probability of success in independent trials.

### Sample Usage

```gse
NEGBINOMDIST(4,2,0.1)
NEGBINOMDIST(A2,A3,A4)
```

### Syntax

```gse
NEGBINOMDIST(num_failures, num_successes, prob_success)
```

- `num_failures` - The number of failures to model.
- `num_successes` - The number of successes to model.
- `prob_success` - The probability of success in any given trial.

### Notes

- `NEGBINOMDIST` models the negative binomial distribution, which is related to the binomial distribution except that the number of trials is variable whereas the number of successes is fixed.

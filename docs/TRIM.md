Removes leading, trailing, and repeated spaces in text.

### Sample Usage

```gse
TRIM(" lorem ipsum")
TRIM(A2)
```

### Syntax

```gse
TRIM(text)
```

- `text` - The string or reference to a cell containing a string to be trimmed.

### Notes

- Google Sheets trims text input into cells by default.
- It is important to use `TRIM` when text is used in formulas or data validation because spaces in front of or after the text are significant.
- `TRIM` removes all spaces in a text string, leaving just a single space between words.
- Whitespace or non-breaking space will not be trimmed.

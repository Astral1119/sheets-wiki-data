Calculates the kurtosis of a dataset, which describes the shape, and in particular the "peakedness" of that dataset.

### Sample Usage

`KURT(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)`

`KURT(A2:A100)`

### Syntax

`KURT(value1, [value2, ...])`

* `value1` - The first value or range of the dataset.
* `value2, ...` - Additional values or ranges to include in the dataset.

### Notes

* Although `KURT` is specified as taking a maximum of 30 arguments, Google Sheets supports an arbitrary number of arguments for this function.
* If the total number of values supplied as `value` arguments is not at least two, `KURT` will return the `#DIV/0!` error.
* Any text encountered in the `value` arguments will be ignored.
* Positive kurtosis indicates a more "peaked" distribution in the dataset, while negative kurtosis indicates a flatter distribution.

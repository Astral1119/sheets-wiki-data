Returns the position at which a string is first found within text counting each double-character as 2.

### Sample Usage

`FINDB("新", "农历新年", 2)`

### Syntax

`FINDB(search_for, text_to_search, [starting_at])`

* `search_for` - The string to look for within `text_to_search`.
* - The text to search for the first occurrence of `search_for`.
* `starting_at` - **[** OPTIONAL - `1` by default **]** - The character position within `text_to_search` at which to start the search.

### Notes

* If `search_for` is not found, the `#VALUE!` error value is returned.
* Ensure that `search_for` and `text_to_search` are not supplied in reverse order, or the `#VALUE!` error will likely be returned. The arguments are supplied in a different order than other text functions such as `SPLIT` and `SUBSTITUTE`.
* It's recommended to use a function such as `IFERROR` to check for cases when there aren't matches to the search.
* Use `FIND` for standard character sets, and `FINDB` for double-byte character sets such as Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), and Korean.

Calculates the equivalent annualized rate of return of a US Treasury Bill based on discount rate.

### Sample Usage

`TBILLEQ(DATE(2010,1,2), DATE(2010,12,31), .09)`

`TBILLEQ(A2,B2,C2)`

### Syntax

`TBILLEQ(settlement, maturity, discount)`

* `settlement` - The settlement date of the security, the date after issuance when the security is delivered to the buyer.
* `maturity` - The maturity or end date of the security, when it can be redeemed at face or par value.
* `discount` - The discount rate of the bill at time of purchase.

### Notes

* `settlement` and `maturity` should be entered using `DATE`, `TO_DATE` or other date parsing functions rather than by entering text.

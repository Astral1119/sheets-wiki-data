Returns the result of multiplying a series of complex numbers together.

### Sample Usage

```gse
IMPRODUCT(A2:A100)
IMPRODUCT("1+2i",3,"4i")
IMPRODUCT("1+2i","3+5i",A2:A50)
```

### Syntax

```gse
IMPRODUCT(factor1, [factor2, ...])
```

- `factor1` - The first complex number or range to calculate for the product.
- `factor2`, ... - [ OPTIONAL ] - More complex numbers to multiply by.

### Notes

- The product of two complex numbers is defined as follows:
  + (a+bi)(c+di) = (ac-bd) + (ad+bc)i
- You can multiply complex numbers only if they have the same suffix (i or j). For example, you can't do `IMPRODUCT("4+3i", "1+2j")`.

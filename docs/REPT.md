Returns specified text repeated a number of times.

### Sample Usage

`REPT("ha",4)`

`REPT(A2,3)`

### Syntax

`REPT(text_to_repeat, number_of_repetitions)`

* `text_to_repeat` - The character or string to repeat.
* `number_of_repetitions` - The number of times `text_to_repeat` should appear in the value returned.

  + The `number_of_repetitions` can’t exceed the character limit of a cell, 32,000 characters. If `number_of_repetitions` is greater than 32,000 characters, REPT will return a `#VALUE!` error.

### Notes

* `REPT` does not insert spaces between repetitions of `text_to_repeat`. If spaces are desired, a space must be appended to the end of the value of `text_to_repeat`. The resulting return value from `REPT` will have at least one trailing space, which may be removed with [[TRIM]].

### See Also

[[TRIM]]: Removes leading, trailing, and repeated spaces in text.

[[SUBSTITUTE]]: Replaces existing text with new text in a string.

[[SPLIT]]: Divides text around a specified character or string, and puts each fragment into a separate cell in the row.

Returns a date representing the last day of a month which falls a specified number of months before or after another date.

### Sample Usage

```gse
EOMONTH(DATE(1969, 7, 20), 1)
EOMONTH(A2, 1)
EOMONTH(40909, -2)
```

### Syntax

```gse
EOMONTH(start_date, months)
```

- `start_date` - The date from which to calculate the result.
- `months` - The number of months before (negative) or after (positive) `start_date` to consider. The last calendar day of the calculated month is returned.

### Notes

- Ensure that the `start_date` input to the function is either a reference to a cell containing a date, a function which returns a date object such as [[DATE]], [[DATEVALUE]] or [[TO_DATE]], or a date serial number of the type returned by the [[N]] function. Google Sheets represents dates and times as numbers; while conversion is automatic when a human-readable date is entered into a cell, functions only accept literal dates in numeric format.
- `EOMONTH` does not autoconvert number formats in the same way that Google Sheets does upon direct entry into cells. Therefore, `EOMONTH(10/10/2000,1)` is interpreted as `EOMONTH(0.0005,1)`, the quotient of 10 divided by 10 divided by 2000.
- Non-integer arguments to `months` will have their decimal components truncated. Therefore, `EOMONTH(A2,2.6)` is equivalent to `EOMONTH(A2,2)`.

### See Also

[[TO_DATE]]: Converts a provided number to a date.

[[N]]: Returns the argument provided as a number.

[[EDATE]]: Returns a date a specified number of months before or after another date.

[[DATEVALUE]]: Converts a provided date string in a known format to a date value.

### Examples

Returns the date of the last day of a month which falls `months` away from the given `start_date`.

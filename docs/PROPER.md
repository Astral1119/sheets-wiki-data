Capitalizes each word in a specified string.

### Sample Usage

```gse
PROPER("united states")
PROPER(A2)
```

### Syntax

```gse
PROPER(text_to_capitalize)
```

- `text_to_capitalize` - The text which will be returned with the first letter of each word in uppercase and all other letters in lowercase.

### Notes

- `PROPER` is useful for proper nouns, such as names of people or geographic locations.
- `PROPER` capitalizes each word in `text_to_capitalize` rather than the beginning of each sentence, and is therefore likely not the correct tool to use for paragraphs or other blocks of text.
- `PROPER` will convert all characters not at the beginning of words to lowercase, which may cause problems with certain strings. For example, using `PROPER("mcLeod")` to capitalize the surname McLeod results in "Mcleod" instead.

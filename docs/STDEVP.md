Calculates the standard deviation based on an entire population.

STDEVP for BigQuery

Calculates the population standard deviation of a data column.

### Sample Usage

`STDEVP(table_name!price)`

Syntax
------

`STDEVP(column)`

* `column` - The data column of the population.

**Tip**: Returning population standard deviation across multiple columns is not supported

### Sample Usage

`STDEVP(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)`

`STDEVP(A2:A100)`

### Syntax

`STDEVP(value1, [value2, ...])`

* `value1` - The first value or range of the population.
* `value2, ...` - Additional values or ranges to include in the population.

### Notes

* Although `STDEVP` is specified as taking a maximum of 30 arguments, Google Sheets supports an arbitrary number of arguments for this function.
* If the total number of values supplied as `value` arguments is not at least two, `STDEVP` will return the `#DIV/0!` error.
* `STDEVP` will return an error if any of the `value` arguments include text. To calculate standard deviation while interpreting text values as `0`, use `STDEVPA`.
* `STDEVP` calculates standard deviation for an entire population. To calculate standard deviation across a sample, use `STDEV`.
* `STDEVP` is equivalent to the square root of the variance, or `SQRT(VARP(...))` using the same dataset.

The STDEV function calculates the standard deviation based on a sample.

STDEV for BigQuery

Calculates the sample standard deviation of a data column.

### Sample Usage

`STDEV(table_name!price)`

Syntax
------

`STDEV(column)`

* `column` - The data column of the sample.

**Tip:** Returning sample standard deviation across multiple columns is not supported

### Sample Usage

`STDEV(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)`

`STDEV(A2:A100)`

### Syntax

`STDEV(value1, [value2, ...])`

* `value1` - The first value or range of the sample.
* `value2, ...` - **[** OPTIONAL **]** - Additional values or ranges to include in the sample.

### Notes

* Although `STDEV` is specified as taking a maximum of 30 arguments, Google Sheets supports an arbitrary number of arguments for this function.
* If the total number of values supplied as `value` arguments is not at least two, `STDEV` will return the `#DIV/0!` error.
* `STDEV` will return an error if any of the `value` arguments include text. If any of the `value` arguments reference a cell that contains text, those cells are ignored. To calculate standard deviation while interpreting text values as `0`, use `STDEVA`.
* `STDEV` calculates standard deviation for a sample. To calculate standard deviation across an entire population, use `STDEVP`.
* `STDEV` is equivalent to the square root of the variance, or `SQRT(VAR(...))` using the same dataset.

Rounds a number down to the nearest integer that is less than or equal to it.

### Sample Usage

```gse
INT(99.44)
INT(A2)
```

### Syntax

```gse
INT(value)
```

- `value` - The value to round down to the nearest integer..

### Notes

- `INT` is *not* equivalent to `ROUNDDOWN` with `places` set to `0`. `INT` rounds down using value, whereas `ROUNDDOWN` rounds down using absolute value, which causes differences for negative values of `value`.
- `INT` is also *not* equivalent to `FLOOR` with significance `-1` for negative values of `value` for the same reason as above. It is, however, equivalent to `FLOOR` with significance `1` for positive values of `value` and `CEILING` with significance `-1` for negative values of `value`.

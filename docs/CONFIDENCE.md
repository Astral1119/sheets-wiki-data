Calculates the width of half the confidence interval for a normal distribution.

### Sample Usage

```gse
CONFIDENCE.NORM(0.05,1.6,250)
CONFIDENCE.NORM(A2,A3,A4)
```

### Syntax

```gse
CONFIDENCE.NORM(alpha, standard_deviation, pop_size)
```

- `alpha` - One minus the desired confidence level. E.g. `0.1` for `0.9`, or 90%, confidence.
- `standard_deviation` - The standard deviation of the population.
- `pop_size` - The size of the population.

### Notes

- `CONFIDENCE.NORM` calculates the width of half the confidence interval such that a value picked at random from the data set has `1-alpha` probability of lying within the mean plus or minus the result of `CONFIDENCE.NORM`.
- You can use `CONFIDENCE` or `CONFIDENCE.NORM` to perform this function.

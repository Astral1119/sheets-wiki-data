SUMIF for BigQuery

Returns a conditional sum of a data column.

Sample Usage
------------

`=SUMIF(table_name!price, ">5", table_name!inventory)`

Syntax
------

`SUMIF(criteria_column, criterion, sum_column)`

* `criteria_column` - The data column which is tested against criterion.
* `criterion` - The pattern or test to apply to criteria\_column.
* `sum_column` - The data column to be summed, if different from `criteria\_column`.

**Tip:** Returning sum across multiple columns is not supported.

### Sample Usage

`SUMIF(A1:A10,">20")`

`SUMIF(A1:A10,"Paid",B1:B10)`

### Syntax

`SUMIF(range, criterion, [sum_range])`

* `range` - The range which is tested against `criterion`.
* `criterion` - The pattern or test to apply to `range`.

  + If `range` contains text to check against, `criterion` must be a string. `criterion` can contain wildcards including `?` to match any single character or `*` to match zero or more contiguous characters. To match an actual question mark or asterisk, prefix the character with the tilde (`~`) character (i.e. `~?` and `~*`). A string criterion must be enclosed in quotation marks. Each cell in `range` is then checked against `criterion` for equality (or match, if wildcards are used).
  + If `range` contains numbers to check against, `criterion` may be either a string or a number. If a number is provided, each cell in `range` is checked for equality with `criterion`. Otherwise, `criterion` may be a string containing a number (which also checks for equality), or a number prefixed with any of the following operators: `=` (checks for equality), `>` (checks that the range cell value is greater than the criterion value), or `<` (checks that the range cell value is less than the criterion value)
* `sum_range` - The range to be summed, if different from `range`.

### Notes

* `SUMIF` can only perform conditional sums with a single criterion. To use multiple criteria, use the database function `DSUM`.

Calculates the probability of drawing a certain number of successes in a certain number of tries given a population of a certain size containing a certain number of successes, without replacement of draws.

### Sample Usage

`HYPGEOMDIST(4,12,20,40)`

`HYPGEOMDIST(A2,A3,A4,A5)`

### Syntax

`HYPGEOMDIST(num_successes, num_draws, successes_in_pop, pop_size)`

* `num_successes` - The desired number of successes.
* `num_draws` - The number of permitted draws.
* `successes_in_pop` - The total number of successes in the population.
* `pop_size` - The total size of the population

### Notes

* `BINOMDIST` describes the probability of drawing a certain number of successes in a certain number of tries given a population of a certain size containing a certain number of successes, *with* replacement of draws.

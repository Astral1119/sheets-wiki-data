The BASE function converts a decimal number into a text representation in another base. For example, base 2 for binary.

Parts of a BASE function
------------------------

`BASE(value, base, [min_length])`

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Part** | **Description** | **Notes** |
| `value` | The number to convert into base. | * The value should be an integer greater than or equal to zero. |
| `base` | The base (or radix) to convert the value number into. | * The base should be an integer from 2 to 36. |
| `min_length` | **(Optional)** The minimum length of the text returned. | * If the minimum length value is greater than the number of significant digits in the result, the result is left-padded with zeroes until the total number of digits reaches significant\_digits. |

Sample formulas
---------------

`BASE(255, 16)`

`BASE(A2, 2)`

`BASE(4095, 16, 6)`

Notes
-----

* Non-integer numeric argument values are truncated to an integer.
* Make sure that any calculations using the result of the BASE function take into account that it may be in a non-decimal base. Results are silently converted by Google Sheets. For example, if cell A2 contains 1111 (the binary equivalent of the decimal value 31), and B2 contains a formula such as "=A2+9," the result will be 11120, which is incorrect in binary calculation.

Examples
--------

This example converts the decimal number 255 to base 16 (hexadecimal):

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | **A** | **B** |
| **1** | **Formula** | **Result** |
| **2** | =BASE(255, 16) | FF |

This example converts the number in cell A2 (decimal value 21) to the base given in cell B2 (binary):

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | **A** | **B** | **C** | **D** |
| **1** | **Number** | **Base** | **Formula** | **Result** |
| **2** | 21 | 2 | =BASE(A2, B2) | 10101 |

This example converts the decimal number 4095 to base 16 (hexadecimal) with a minimum length of 6 characters:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | **A** | **B** |
| **1** | **Formula** | **Result** |
| **2** | =BASE(4095, 16, 6) | 000FFF |

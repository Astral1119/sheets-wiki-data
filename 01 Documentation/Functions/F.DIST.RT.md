The F.DIST.RT function calculates the right-tailed F probability distribution (degree of diversity) for two data sets with given input x.Â Alternately called Fisher-Snedecor distribution or Snedecor's F distribution.

### Sample Usage

`F.DIST.RT(15.35, 7, 6)`

`F.DIST.RT(A2, B2, C2)`

### Syntax

`F.DIST.RT(x, degrees_freedom1, degrees_freedom2)`

* `x` - The input to the F probability distribution function. The value at which to evaluate the function.

  + Must be a positive number.
* `degrees_freedom1` - The numerator of the number of degrees of freedom.
* `degrees_freedom2` - The denominator of the number of degrees of freedom.

### Notes

* Both `degrees_freedom1` and `degrees_freedom2` are truncated to an integer in the calculation if a non-integer is provided as an argument.
* Both `degrees_freedom1` and `degrees_freedom2` must be greater than `1` and may not exceed `10^10`.
* All arguments must be numeric.
* `F.DIST.RT` is synonymous with `FDIST`.

### Examples

In this example, suppose you want to determine whether the data for hours spent studying each week have different variability for engineering majors at University A than at University B. We will evaluate the curve of F Distribution when `x` equals `15.35`, and use `7` and `6` for `degrees_freedom1` and `degrees_freedom2` respectively.

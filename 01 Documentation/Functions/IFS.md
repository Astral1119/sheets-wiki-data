Evaluates multiple conditions and returns a value that corresponds to the first true condition.

### Sample Usage

`IFS(A1>90, "A", A1>80, "B", A1>70, "C")`

`IFS({A1:A5} > 3, "bigger", {A1:A5} = 3, "equal")`

### Syntax

`IFS(condition1, value1, [condition2, value2, …])`

* `condition1` - The first condition to be evaluated. This can be a boolean, a number, an array, or a reference to any of those.
* `value1` - The returned value if `condition1` is `TRUE`.
* `condition2, value2, …` - Additional conditions and values if the first one is evaluated to be false.

### Notes

* If all conditions are FALSE, #N/A is returned.

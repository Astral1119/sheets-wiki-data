This function scans an array and produces intermediate values by application of a `LAMBDA` function to each value. Returns an array of the intermediate values obtained at each step.

Sample Usage
------------

`SCAN(5, A1:A3, LAMBDA(accumulator, current_value, accumulator+current_value))`

`SCAN(2, A1:A3, LAMBDA(accumulator, current_value, accumulator*current_value))`

Syntax
------

`SCAN(initial_value, array_or_range, LAMBDA)`

* `initial_value`: The initial `accumulator` value.
* `array_or_range`: An array or range to be scanned.
* `LAMBDA`: A `LAMBDA` that’s applied to each value in `array_or_range` for scanning it.
  + **Syntax:** `LAMBDA(name1, name2, formula_expression)`
  + **Requirements:**
    - The `LAMBDA` must have exactly 2 `name` arguments along with a `formula_expression` which uses those `names`. The `name1` resolves to the current value in the `accumulator` and `name2` resolves to the `current_value` in `array_or_range`, when applying the `LAMBDA`. The `accumulator` is updated in each step to the intermediate value obtained in the previous step.

Notes
-----

* The passed `LAMBDA` should accept exactly 2 `name` arguments, otherwise an `#N/A` error is returned. These arguments correspond to `accumulator` and `current_value`, in order. These are explained as:
  + `name1`: Resolves to the valuein the `accumulator`.
  + `name2`: Resolves to the `current_value` in the input array.
* The `accumulator` is initialized by `initial_value` and updated in each step to the intermediate value obtained in the previous step.

* The `current_value` in the input array are found row by row, while you apply the `LAMBDA.`

* A `named function` can be passed for the `LAMBDA` parameter and behaves like a `LAMBDA` in this case. [[Learn more about named functions]].
  + The `named function` must follow the `LAMBDA` syntax for `SCAN` with exactly 2 argument placeholders defined for it.
  + The `named function` shouldn't be followed by parenthesis.

Examples
--------

### Return the running total of an array

**Example data:**

|  | **A** |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | 4 |
| **2** | 2 |
| **3** | 1 |

**Example:** `=SCAN(5, A1:A3, LAMBDA(accumulator, current_value, accumulator+current_value))`

**Result:**

|  |
| --- |
| 9 |
| 11 |
| 12 |

### Return the cumulative percentage of total value

**Example data:**

|  | **A** |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | 4 |
| **2** | 2 |
| **3** | 1 |

**Example**: `=SCAN(0, A1:A3, LAMBDA(accumulator, current_value, accumulator + current_value/sum(A1:A3)))`

**Result:**

|  |
| --- |
| 0.57 |
| 0.85 |
| 1 |

### Return the running total of an array and restart calculation when the number is 0 with a named function as LAMBDA.

**Example data:**

|  | **A** |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | 4 |
| **2** | 2 |
| **3** | 1 |
| **4** | 0 |
| **5** | 3 |
| **6** | 6 |

**Example:** `=SCAN(0, A1:A6, RUNNING_TOTAL_0)`

**Named function:** `RUNNING_TOTAL_0` is a `named function` which outputs the running total of the array and restarts the calculation when the `current_value` is 0.

**Formula definition:** `=if(current_value=0, current_value, accumulator+current_value)`, where `accumulator` and `current_value` are argument placeholders defined for `RUNNING_TOTAL_0`.

**Result:**

|  |
| --- |
| 4 |
| 6 |
| 7 |
| 0 |
| 3 |
| 9 |

Common Errors
-------------

The passed LAMBDA doesn't have exactly 2 name arguments

If the `LAMBDA` function doesn’t have 2 `name` arguments, this error occurs:

“Wrong number of arguments to LAMBDA. Expected 3 arguments, but got 2 arguments."

**Example:** `=SCAN(5, C1:C4, LAMBDA(current_value, current_value+1))`

In this example, LAMBDA was given only 1 `name` argument when it needed 2.

The last parameter of SCAN wasn’t a LAMBDA

If the last parameter of `SCAN` function wasn’t a `LAMBDA` function, this error occurs:

“Argument must be a LAMBDA.”

**Example:** `=SCAN(5, C1:C4, 3)`

In this example the last function is `3`, instead of a `LAMBDA` function.

The LAMBDA passed to SCAN was incorrect

If 1 or more `name` arguments aren’t valid, this error occurs:

“Argument 1 of function LAMBDA is not a valid name.”

**Example:** `=SCAN(5, C1:C4, LAMBDA(C1, v, C1+v))`

In this example, `C1` is an invalid `name` since it clashes with a range.

One or more intermediate values produced by the application of LAMBDA are not single values

If the application of `LAMBDA` on the input array produces any non-single intermediate value, this error occurs:

“Single value expected. Nested array results are not supported.”

**Example:** `=SCAN(5, C1:C4, LAMBDA(accumulator, value, {accumulator, value}))`

Every application of `LAMBDA` must produce an intermediate value which is a single value only and can’t be another array.

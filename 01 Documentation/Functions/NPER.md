The NPER function calculates the number of payment periods for an investment based on constant-amount periodic payments and a constant interest rate.

### Sample Usage

`NPER(2,500,40000)`

`NPER(A2,B2,C2,D2,1)`

### Syntax

`NPER(rate, payment_amount, present_value, [future_value, end_or_beginning])`

* `rate` - The interest rate.
* `payment_amount` - The amount of each payment made.
* `present_value` - The current value of the annuity.
* `future_value` - **[** OPTIONAL **]** - The future value remaining after the final payment has been made.
* `end_or_beginning` - **[** OPTIONAL - `0` by default **]** - Whether payments are due at the end (`0`) or beginning (`1`) of each period.

### Notes

* Ensure that consistent units are used for `rate` and `payment_amount`. For example, a car loan for 36 months may be paid monthly, in which case the annual percentage rate should be divided by 12 and the `payment_amount` is the amount of each monthly payment. On the other hand, a different type of loan of the same length and principal might be paid quarterly, in which case the annual percentage rate should be divided by 4 and the amount paid each period would be adjusted accordingly..

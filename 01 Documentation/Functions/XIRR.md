Calculates the internal rate of return of an investment based on a specified series of potentially irregularly spaced cash flows.

### Sample Usage

`XIRR(B2:B25,C2:C25)`

`XIRR({-4000,200,250,300},{DATE(2012,01,01),DATE(2012,06,23),DATE(2013,05,12),DATE(2014,02,09)},0.09)`

### Syntax

`XIRR(cashflow_amounts, cashflow_dates, [rate_guess])`

* `cashflow_amounts` - An array or range containing the income or payments associated with the investment.

  + `cashflow_amounts` must contain at least one negative and one positive cash flow to calculate rate of return.
* `cashflow_dates` - An array or range with dates corresponding to the cash flows in `cashflow_amounts`.
* `rate_guess` - **[** OPTIONAL - 0.1 by default **]** - An estimate for what the internal rate of return will be.

### Notes

* If the days specified in `cashflow_dates` are at a regular interval, use `IRR` instead.
* Each cell in `cashflow_amounts` should be positive if it represents income from the perspective of the owner of the investment (e.g. coupons) or negative if it represents payments (e.g. loan repayment).
* `XNPV` will return zero if `discount` is set to the result of `XIRR` using the same cash flow amounts and schedule.

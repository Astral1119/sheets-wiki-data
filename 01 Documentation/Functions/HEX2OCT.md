The HEX2OCT function converts a signed hexadecimal number to signed octal format.

### Sample Usage

`HEX2OCT("f3",8)`

`HEX2OCT(A2)`

### Syntax

`HEX2OCT(signed_hexadecimal_number, [significant_digits])`

* `signed_hexadecimal_number` - The signed 40-bit hexadecimal value to be converted to signed octal, provided as a string.

  + The most significant bit of `signed_hexadecimal_number` is the sign bit; that is, negative numbers are represented in two's complement format.
  + For this function, this value has a maximum of 1FFFFFFF if positive, and a minimum of FFE0000000 if negative.
  + If `signed_hexadecimal_number` is provided as a valid hexadecimal number, it will automatically be converted to the appropriate string input. For example, `HEX2OCT(199)` and `HEX2OCT("199")` yield the same result: `631`.
* `significant_digits` - **[** OPTIONAL **]** The number of significant digits to ensure in the result.

  + If this is greater than the number of significant digits in the result, the result is left-padded with zeros until the total number of digits reaches `significant_digits`.
  + This value is ignored if the most significant bit of `signed_hexadecimal_number` is `1`; that is, if the expressed `signed_hexadecimal_number` is greater than or equal to 8000000000.

### Notes

* As with any hexadecimal value, only the digits `0-9` and the letters `A-F` are valid. Digits other than these will cause `HEX2OCT` to return a `#NUM!` error.

  + Hexadecimal digits are not case-sensitive; `a-f` and `A-F` are equivalent.
* If the number of digits required is greater than the specified `significant_digits`, the `#NUM!` error is returned.
* Ensure that any calculations using the result of HEX2OCT take into account that it is in octal. Results will be silently converted by Google Sheets; thus if cell `A2` contains `111`, the octal equivalent of hexadecimal `49`, and `B2` contains a formula such as `=A2+9`, the result will be `120`, which is incorrect in octal calculation.

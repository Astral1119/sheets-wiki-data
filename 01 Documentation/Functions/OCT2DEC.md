The OCT2DEC function converts a signed octal number to decimal format.

### Sample Usage

`OCT2DEC(37)`

`OCT2DEC(A2)`

### Syntax

`OCT2DEC(signed_octal_number)`

* `signed_octal_number` - The signed 30-bit octal value to be converted to decimal, provided as a string.

  + The most significant bit of `signed_octal_number` is the sign bit; that is, negative numbers are represented in two's complement format.
  + For this function, this value has a maximum of 3777777777 if positive, and a minimum of 4000000000 if negative.
  + If `signed_octal_number` is provided as a valid octal number, it will automatically be converted to the appropriate string input. For example, `OCT2DEC(177)` and `OCT2DEC("177")` yield the same result: `127`.

### Notes

* As with any octal value, only the digits 0-7 are valid. Digits outside of this will cause `OCT2DEC` to return a `#NUM!` error.

The PERMUTATIONA function returns the number of permutations for selecting a group of objects (with replacement) from a total number of objects. Mathematically, it is equivalent to raising the total number of objects to the number of objects being chosen.

Parts of a PERMUTATIONA function
--------------------------------

`PERMUTATIONA(number, number_chosen)`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Part** | **Description** |
| `number` | Required. The total number of objects to choose from. |
| `number_chosen` | Required. The number of objects to choose from number. Must be less than or equal to number. |

Notes
-----

* Both arguments are truncated to integers.
* If the number is zero, `PERMUTATIONA` returns a #NUM.

Examples
--------

Result for A1=`PERMUTATIONA(3, 2)`, A2=`PERMUTATIONA(3.2, 2)`, A3= `PERMUTATIONA(3, 2.4)`.

**Note:** All functions return the same result due to truncation.

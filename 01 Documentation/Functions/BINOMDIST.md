Calculates the probability of drawing a certain number of successes (or a maximum number of successes) in a certain number of tries given a population of a certain size containing a certain number of successes, with replacement of draws.

### Sample Usage

`BINOMDIST(4,100,0.005,FALSE)`

`BINOMDIST(A2,A3,A4,TRUE)`

### Syntax

`BINOMDIST(num_successes, num_trials, prob_success, cumulative)`

* `num_successes` - The number of successes for which to calculate the probability in `num_trials` trials.

  + If `cumulative` is `TRUE` then `BINOMDIST` returns the probability of `num_successes` or fewer successes, otherwise the probability of exactly `num_successes` successes.
* `num_trials` - The number of independent trials.
* `prob_success` - The probability of success in any given trial.
* `cumulative` - **[** `FALSE` by default **]** - Whether to use the binomial cumulative distribution.

### Notes

* `HYPGEOMDIST` describes the probability of drawing a certain number of successes in a certain number of tries given a population of a certain size containing a certain number of successes, *without* replacement of draws.

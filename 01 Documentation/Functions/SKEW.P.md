The SKEW.P function calculates the skewness of a dataset that represents the entire population. Skewness describes the symmetry of that dataset about the mean.

Parts of a SKEW.P function
--------------------------

`SKEW.P(value1, value2)`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Part** | **Description** |
| `value1` | The first value or range of the dataset. |
| `value2` | Additional values or ranges to include in the dataset. |

Notes
-----

* Although `SKEW.P` is specified as taking a maximum of 30 arguments, Google Sheets supports an arbitrary number of arguments for this function.
* If the total number of values supplied as `value` arguments is not at least two, `SKEW.P` will return the `#DIV/0!`error.
* Any text encountered in the `value` arguments will be ignored.
* Positive skewness indicates a longer tail extending in the positive direction, to the right of the mean, while negative skewness indicates a longer tail in the negative direction, to the left. Skewness nearer to zero indicates more symmetrical distributions.

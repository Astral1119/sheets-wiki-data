Calculates the variance based on an entire population, setting text to the value `0`.

### Sample Usage

`VARPA(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)`

`VARPA(A2:A100)`

### Syntax

`VARPA(value1, [value2, ...])`

* `value1` - The first value or range of the population.
* `value2, ...` - Additional values or ranges to include in the population.

### Notes

* Although `VARPA` is specified as taking a maximum of 30 arguments, Google Sheets supports an arbitrary number of arguments for this function.
* If the total number of values supplied as `value` arguments is not at least two, `VARPA` will return the `#NUM!` error.
* `VARPA` sets each text value encountered to `0` for the purpose of calculation. To return an error upon encountering text, use `VARP`.
* `VARPA` calculates variance for an entire population. To calculate variance across a sample, use `VARA`.
* `VARPA` takes the sum of the squares of each value's deviation from the mean and divides by the number of such values. This differs from the calculation of variance across a sample in that the latter divides by the size of the dataset minus one.

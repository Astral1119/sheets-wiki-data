Calculates the probability for Student's t-distribution with a given input (x).

### Sample Usage

`TDIST(A2, 30, 1)`

`TDIST(0.5, 1, 2)`

### Syntax

`TDIST(x, degrees_freedom, tails)`

* `x` - The input to the t-distribution function.
* `degrees_freedom` - The number of degrees of freedom.
* `tails` - Specifies whether the calculated distribution will be one- or two-sided. (1 for one-tailed distributions, 2 for two-tailed distributions).

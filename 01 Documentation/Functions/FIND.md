Returns the position at which a string is first found within text, case-sensitive.

### Sample Usage

`FIND("n",A2)`

`FIND("wood","How much wood can a woodchuck chuck",14)`

### Syntax

`FIND(search_for, text_to_search, [starting_at])`

* `search_for` - The string to look for within `text_to_search`.
* `text_to_search` - The text to search for the first occurrence of `search_for`.
* `starting_at` - **[** OPTIONAL - `1` by default **]** - The character within `text_to_search` at which to start the search.

### Notes

* `FIND` is case-sensitive, meaning that uppercase and lowercase letters matter. For example, "abc" will not match "ABC". To ignore case, use the [[SEARCH]] function.
* Ensure that `search_for` and `text_to_search` are not supplied in reverse order, or the `#VALUE!` error will likely be returned. The arguments are supplied in a different order than other text functions such as [[SPLIT]] and [[SUBSTITUTE]].
* It's recommended to use a function such as [[IFERROR]] to check for cases when there aren't matches to the search.
* If the pattern you're searching for isn't found, `#VALUE!` is returned.

Returns the sum of a series of complex numbers or cells or both.

### Sample Usage

`IMSUM(A2:A100)`

`IMSUM("1+2i",3,"4i")`

`IMSUM("1+2i","3+5i",A2:A50)`

### Syntax

`IMSUM(value1, [value2, ...])`

* `value1` - The first complex number or range to add together.
* `value2`, ... - [ OPTIONAL ] - More complex numbers or ranges to add to `value1`.

### Notes

* The sum of two complex numbers is defined as follows:
  + (a+bi) + (c+di) = (a+c) + (b+d)i
* You can sum complex numbers only if they have the same suffix (i or j). For example, you can't do `IMSUM("4+3i", "1+2j")`.

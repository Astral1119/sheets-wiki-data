The PHI function returns the value of the density function for a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1, calculated with the formula ![](//screenshot.googleplex.com/ic8chm1AB8s.png).

Parts of a PHI function
-----------------------

`PHI(x)`

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Parts** | **Description** |
| `x` | The input to the standard normal distribution function. |

Sample formula
--------------

`PHI(0.25)`

Notes
-----

This is a special case of the NORMDIST function, where mean is 0, standard deviation is 1, and 'cumulative' is false.

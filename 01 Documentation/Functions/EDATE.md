Returns a date a specified number of months before or after another date.

### Sample Usage

`EDATE(DATE(1969,7,20), 1)`

`EDATE(A2, 1)`

`EDATE(40909, -2)`

### Syntax

`EDATE(start_date, months)`

* `start_date` - The date from which to calculate the result.
* `months` - The number of months before (negative) or after (positive) `start_date` to calculate.

### Notes

* Ensure that the `start_date` input to the function is either a reference to a cell containing a date, a function which returns a date object such as [[DATE]], [[DATEVALUE]] or [[TO_DATE]], or a date serial number of the type returned by the [[N]] function. Google Sheets represents dates and times as numbers; while conversion is automatic when a human-readable date is entered into a cell, functions only accept literal dates in numeric format.
* `EDATE` does not autoconvert number formats in the same way that Google Sheets does upon direct entry into cells. Therefore, `EDATE(10/10/2000,1)` is interpreted as `EDATE(0.005,1)`, the quotient of 10 divided by 10 divided by 2000.
* Non-integer arguments to `months` will have their decimal components truncated. Therefore, `EDATE(A2,2.6)` is equivalent to `EDATE(A2,2)`.

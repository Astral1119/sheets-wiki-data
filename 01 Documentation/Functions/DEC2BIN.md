The DEC2BIN function converts a decimal number to signed binary format.

### Sample Usage

`DEC2BIN("100",8)`

`DEC2BIN(A2)`

### Syntax

`DEC2BIN(decimal_number, [significant_digits])`

* `decimal_number` - The decimal value to be converted to signed binary, provided as a string.

  + For this function, this value has a maximum of 511 if positive, and a minimum of -512 if negative.
  + If `decimal_number` is provided as a valid decimal number, it will automatically be converted to the appropriate string input. For example, `DEC2BIN(199)` and `DEC2BIN("199")` yield the same result: `11000111`.
* `significant_digits` - **[** OPTIONAL **]** The number of significant digits to ensure in the result.

  + If this is greater than the number of significant digits in the result, the result is left-padded with zeros until the total number of digits reaches `significant_digits`.
  + This value is ignored if `decimal_number` is negative.

### Notes

* If the number of digits required is greater than the specified `significant_digits`, the `#NUM!` error is returned.
* Ensure that any calculations using the result of DEC2BIN take into account that it is in binary. Results will be silently converted by Google Sheets; thus if cell `A2` contains `11111`, the binary equivalent of the decimal value `31`, and `B2` contains a formula such as `=A2+9`, the result will be `11120`, which is incorrect in binary calculation.

The IMLOG2 function returns the logarithm of a complex number with base 2.

Parts of an IMLOG2 formula
--------------------------

`IMLOG2(value)`

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Part** | **Description** | **Notes** |
| `value` | The input value of the logarithm function. | * The number can be written as plain numbers, for example 1, to be interpreted as a real number. * The number can be written as quoted text in order to specify both the real and complex coefficients. |

Sample formulas
---------------

`IMLOG2("1+i", 3.5)`

`IMLOG2(COMPLEX(25, 34), 2.3)`

`IMLOG2(100, 10)`

Notes
-----

`IMLOG2` is equivalent to `IMLOG` given base of 2 for all numbers.

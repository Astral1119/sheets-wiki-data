Given a set of values and corresponding probabilities, calculates the probability that a value chosen at random falls between two limits.

### Sample Usage

`PROB({1,2,3,4},{0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25},3)`

`PROB(A2:A100,B2:B100,C2,C3)`

### Syntax

`PROB(data, probabilities, low_limit, [high_limit])`

* `data` - Array or range containing the dataset to consider.
* `probabilities` - Array or range containing probabilities corresponding to `data`.

  + Each value in `probabilities` must be greater than `0` and less than or equal to `1`.
* `low_limit` - The lower bound on the value range for which to calculate the probability.
* `high_limit` - **[** OPTIONAL - `low_limit` by default **]** - The upper bound on the value range for which to calculate the probability.

  + If `high_limit` is omitted, `PROB` calculates the probability that a value chosen at random is exactly equal to `low_limit`.

### Notes

* The number of values in `data` and `probabilities` must be the same.

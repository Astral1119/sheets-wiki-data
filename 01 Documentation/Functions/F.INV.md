Calculates the inverse of the left-tailed F probability distribution. Also called the Fisher-Snedecor distribution or Snedecor’s F distribution.

### Sample Usage

`F.INV(0.42, 2, 3)`

`F.INV(A2, B2, C2)`

### Syntax

`F.INV(probability, degrees_freedom1, degrees_freedom2)`

* `probability` - The probability associated with the left-tailed F-distribution.

  + Must be greater than `0` and less than `1`.
* `degrees_freedom1` - The number of degrees of freedom of the numerator of the test statistic.
* `degrees_freedom2` - The number of degrees of freedom of the denominator of the test statistic.

### Notes

* Both `degrees_freedom1` and `degrees_freedom2` are truncated to an integer in the calculation if a non-integer is provided as an argument.
* Both `degrees_freedom1` and `degrees_freedom2` must be at least `1`.
* All arguments must be numeric.

### Example

Suppose you want to find the cutoff for the F statistic associated with a left-tailed cumulative probability of `0.95`.

Calculates the left-tailed chi-squared distribution, often used in hypothesis testing.

### Sample Usage

`CHISQ.DIST(3.45, 2, TRUE)`

`CHISQ.DIST(A2, B2, TRUE)`

### Syntax

`CHISQ.DIST(x, degrees_freedom, cumulative)`

* `x` - The input to the chi-squared probability distribution function. The value at which to evaluate the function.

  + Must be a positive number.
* `degrees_freedom` - The number of degrees of freedom of the distribution.
* `cumulative` - Logical value that determines the form of the function.

  + If `TRUE: CHI.DIST` returns the left-tailed cumulative distribution function.
  + If `FALSE: CHI.DIST` returns the probability density function.

### Notes

* `degrees_freedom` is truncated to an integer if a non-integer is provided.
* `degrees_freedom` must be at least `1` and may not exceed `10^10`.
* `x` and `degrees_freedom` must be numeric.

### Example

Suppose you want to test the fairness of a 6-sided die:

* From several rolls, you obtain a chi-squared statistic of `12.3`.
* The number of degrees of freedom is `6 - 1 = 5`.
* We will evaluate the chi-squared distribution with `5` degrees of freedom when x equals `12.3`.

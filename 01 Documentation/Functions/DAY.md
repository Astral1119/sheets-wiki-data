Returns the day of the month that a specific date falls on, in numeric format.

### Sample Usage

`DAY(DATE(1969,7,20))`

`DAY(A2)`

`DAY(40909)`

`DAY("7/20/1969")`

### Syntax

`DAY(date)`

* `date` - The date from which to extract the day. Must be a reference to a cell containing a date, a function returning a date type, or a number.

### Notes

* Ensure that the input to the function is either a reference to a cell containing a date, a function which returns a date object such as [[DATE]], [[DATEVALUE]] or [[TO_DATE]], or a date serial number of the type returned by the [[N]] function. Google Sheets represents dates and times as numbers; while conversion is automatic when a human-readable date is entered into a cell, functions only accept literal dates in numeric format.
* `DAY` does not autoconvert number formats in the same way that Google Sheets does upon direct entry into cells. Therefore, `DAY(10/10/2000)` is interpreted as `DAY(0.005)`, the quotient of 10 divided by 10 divided by 2000.
* `DAY` returns the intuitive understanding of the day of the month, and is useful primarily in other calculations rather than to extract the day of month from a known date, as that value is easily known from reading the entire date.

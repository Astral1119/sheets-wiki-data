Calculates the interest rate of an annuity investment based on constant-amount periodic payments and the assumption of a constant interest rate.

### Sample Usage

`RATE(12,-100,400,0,0,0.1)`

`RATE(A2,B2,C2,D2,1,0.08)`

### Syntax

`RATE(number_of_periods, payment_per_period, present_value, [future_value, end_or_beginning, rate_guess])`

* `number_of_periods` - The number of payments to be made.
* `payment_per_period` - The amount per period to be paid.
* `present_value` - The current value of the annuity.
* `future_value` - **[** OPTIONAL **]** - The future value remaining after the final payment has been made.
* `end_or_beginning` - **[** OPTIONAL - `0` by default **]** - Whether payments are due at the end (`0`) or beginning (`1`) of each period.
* `rate_guess` - **[** OPTIONAL - 0.1 by default **]** - An estimate for what the interest rate will be.

sheets.wiki does not delete deprecated articles. This is because of two reasons:
1. Google Sheets experience breaking changes often. In practice, this means that previously deprecated methods can work again without notice.
2. It is important to have an enduring record of deprecated techniques in order to detail the history of working ones.

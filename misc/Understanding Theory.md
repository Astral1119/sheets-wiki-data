While experience is the best way to improve, it can also be helpful to understand the theoretical basis behind how Google Sheets functions work. If you've ever wondered how [[Datetime|dates]] work or why [[SUMIF]] is so annoying to work with, this collection is for you.

This article is ordered from most to least utility. If you are only looking to learn theory to improve at writing formulae, you don't need to know much beyond the native data types.

Theory beyond native data types is heavily steeped in mathematics and computer science. These articles assume some prior knowledge, or at least a willingness to read articles outside of sheets.wiki (e.g. looking up terminology, reading technical Wikipedia articles). However, understanding the fundamental principles behind spreadsheet formulae can help interested readers draw connections to concepts in other languages and disciplines.

### Native data types

Native data types are those that can be identified by [[TYPE]] and [[ERROR.TYPE]]. They include:
- [[Number]]
- [[String]]
- [[Boolean]]
- [[Error]]
- [[Array]

sheets.wiki stores all articles within a folder structure, seen in the file explorer in the sidebar. These folders represent six different categories. They are as follows:

| Category | Description |
| --- | --- |


You can also search for pages using the search bar or with `Cmd + k`.

Additional methods of navigation include the **graph** on the right-hand side, the **backlinks** underneath the graph, and the **breadcrumbs** at the top of the page.

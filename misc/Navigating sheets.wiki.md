sheets.wiki stores all articles within a folder structure, seen in the file explorer in the sidebar.

| Category | Description |
| --- | --- |
| archive | Legacy pages. |
| blog | Blog posts. |
| collections | Curated collections of pages. |

Despite being folder-based, we do not recommend going through folders to find notes. Instead, we recommend going through the collections as jumping-off points or using the search feature for specific pages. You can search for pages using the search bar or with `Cmd + k`.

Additional methods of navigation include the **graph** on the right-hand side, the **backlinks** underneath the graph, and the **breadcrumbs** at the top of the page.

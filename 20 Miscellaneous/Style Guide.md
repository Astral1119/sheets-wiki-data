sheets.wiki is—as its name implies—a wiki, and thus follows similar principles. However, note that this style guide **does not** apply to blog posts.

Generally, this wiki follows Wikipedia's [Manual of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style). However, there are a number of differences, outlined below.

Wikipedia does not allow [original research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research). sheets.wiki does, provided it has been verified and vetted by a maintainer. This includes original spreadsheets, provided you commit to not deleting them without informing a maintainer.

Wikipedia has a number of rules around [external linking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links). sheets.wiki does not, and external linking to reputable sources is encouraged, including in the main text. However, please prioritize references to internal pages (e.g. sheets.wiki pages).

Functions, when possible, should be written capitalized and as [inline code](https://help.obsidian.md/syntax#Inline+code) (e.g. `LAMBDA`). Formulae should use [code blocks](https://help.obsidian.md/syntax#Code+blocks) with the `gse` language code.

Error literals like `#VALUE!` should always be formatted as either inline code or code blocks to prevent them from being interpreted as tags.

All formulae should be written using North American syntax (i.e., comma-separated arguments and North American array literals). Similarly, wiki entries should use North American spellings.

sheets.wiki is not a guidebook. For instructions and advice on how to use functions and techniques, instead write blog posts (which will then be accessible through the function or technique's backlinks). You may link to guides, both external and within the sheets.wiki blog, under a section labeled `Guides`.

Unlike the [[official documentation]], sheets.wiki documentation does not include example usage.

Don't be afraid to create dead links. We can always fill them in later.

Articles about functions and techniques should generally have the following headers:
- Syntax
- Notes
- See Also

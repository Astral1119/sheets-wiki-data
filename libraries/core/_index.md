Anduin is a [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) library for [[LAMBDA UDT]]-based [[Container|containers]].

### Philosophy

- **Functional**: Anduin is designed for a functional programming paradigm, meaning a heavy emphasis on [[LAMBDA]].

- **Efficient**: Anduin is designed to be efficient and optimized for Google Sheets. This means that it may forgo asymptotic optimality in favor of fast JavaScript-native implementations.

- **Accessible**: Anduin is designed to be easy to use and understand. In addition, there is a focus on using Google Sheets-like syntax and conventions for analogous contexts.

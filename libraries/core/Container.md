Containers are [[LAMBDA data structures]] designed to efficiently store and process data using a common interface. They are [purely functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional_data_structure). Unlike [[array|arrays]], containers can store any kind of [[lambda]]

### Syntax

```gse
=CONTAINER(payload)
```

- `CONTAINER`: A [[container]] in the [[libraries/core/_index|Anduin]] library.
- `payload`: A [[method]] or [[lambda term]].
